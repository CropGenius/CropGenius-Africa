# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CropGenius has a powerful backend infrastructure with comprehensive routing and data management capabilities, but the user interface layer is critically disconnected from this backend power. The application currently presents as a "dead spark" instead of the "blazing sun" it should be, with 25+ pages that are either non-functional, incomplete, or improperly connected to the data layer. This project will systematically resurrect every page component to create a fully functional, production-ready agricultural intelligence platform that serves 100 million African farmers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete UI Page Audit and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of all UI pages, so that I can understand the exact scope and nature of failures across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit is initiated THEN the system SHALL analyze every file in src/pages directory
2. WHEN each page is analyzed THEN the system SHALL document its intended purpose, current state, and specific failure points
3. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL produce a master diagnostic document with detailed resurrection plans for each page
4. IF a page has TypeScript errors THEN the system SHALL identify and document the specific error types and locations
5. IF a page lacks proper routing THEN the system SHALL identify missing or incorrect route configurations
6. IF a page lacks data integration THEN the system SHALL identify missing hooks, API calls, or state management connections

### Requirement 2: Systematic Page Resurrection with Data Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want every page in the application to be fully functional with real data, so that I can access all the agricultural intelligence features that have been built.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is resurrected THEN it SHALL be fully connected to the Supabase backend with proper data fetching
2. WHEN a page loads THEN it SHALL display real data from the appropriate database tables or API endpoints
3. WHEN a page encounters errors THEN it SHALL display proper error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN a page is loading data THEN it SHALL display appropriate loading states and skeleton components
5. IF a page requires authentication THEN it SHALL properly integrate with the auth system and redirect unauthorized users
6. IF a page has child components THEN all child components SHALL be properly wired with correct props and state

### Requirement 3: Production-Ready Code Quality and Testing

**User Story:** As a development team, I want all resurrected pages to meet production standards, so that the application is reliable and maintainable for serving millions of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow TypeScript best practices with proper type definitions
2. WHEN a page is completed THEN it SHALL have comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks and error boundaries
3. WHEN a page is resurrected THEN it SHALL have corresponding unit tests that verify functionality
4. WHEN tests are created THEN they SHALL test data fetching, component rendering, and user interactions
5. IF a page has async operations THEN it SHALL handle loading states, success states, and error states appropriately
6. IF a page uses external APIs THEN it SHALL implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Mobile-First Responsive Design Implementation

**User Story:** As a farmer using a mobile device, I want all pages to be fully responsive and optimized for mobile use, so that I can access the platform effectively on my smartphone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is resurrected THEN it SHALL be fully responsive across all device sizes
2. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the page SHALL use the MobileLayout wrapper appropriately
3. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN they SHALL meet minimum touch target sizes (44px)
4. WHEN content is displayed THEN it SHALL be readable and accessible on small screens
5. IF the page has complex layouts THEN it SHALL gracefully adapt to different screen orientations
6. IF the page has navigation elements THEN they SHALL be thumb-friendly and easily accessible

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Data Integration and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want pages to load quickly with real-time data updates, so that I can make timely agricultural decisions based on current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads THEN it SHALL fetch data efficiently using React Query for caching and optimization
2. WHEN data changes THEN the page SHALL update in real-time using Supabase subscriptions where appropriate
3. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN they SHALL be optimized to minimize loading time
4. WHEN images or media are displayed THEN they SHALL be optimized and lazy-loaded
5. IF a page has heavy computations THEN they SHALL be optimized or moved to background processes
6. IF a page requires offline functionality THEN it SHALL implement proper caching and offline states

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Navigation and User Flow Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want seamless navigation between all pages, so that I can efficiently access different features of the agricultural platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation occurs THEN all routes SHALL be properly configured in AppRoutes.tsx
2. WHEN a user navigates THEN the routing SHALL work correctly with proper URL parameters and query strings
3. WHEN protected routes are accessed THEN authentication SHALL be properly enforced
4. WHEN navigation elements are present THEN they SHALL correctly link to functional pages
5. IF a page requires specific permissions THEN access control SHALL be properly implemented
6. IF a page is part of a workflow THEN the navigation flow SHALL be logical and intuitive

### Requirement 7: AI and External Service Integration Verification

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want all AI-powered features to work correctly across all pages, so that I can benefit from the intelligent agricultural insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI features are present THEN they SHALL be properly integrated with the respective AI agents
2. WHEN external APIs are called THEN they SHALL have proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN AI responses are displayed THEN they SHALL be formatted appropriately for user consumption
4. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be shown
5. IF AI services are unavailable THEN graceful degradation SHALL be implemented
6. IF AI features require credits THEN the credit system SHALL be properly integrated

### Requirement 8: Database Schema Alignment and Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all pages to properly align with the database schema, so that data integrity is maintained across the entire platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are made THEN they SHALL use the correct table names and column references
2. WHEN data is displayed THEN it SHALL match the expected database schema structure
3. WHEN data mutations occur THEN they SHALL properly validate against database constraints
4. WHEN relationships exist THEN they SHALL be properly handled with appropriate joins or separate queries
5. IF schema changes have occurred THEN all affected pages SHALL be updated accordingly
6. IF data types don't match THEN proper type conversion and validation SHALL be implemented
