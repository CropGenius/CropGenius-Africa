# UI Resurrection Phoenix - Implementation Plan
THE FORENSIC UI RESURRECTION
Epic: E-001: Unleash the Sun
User Story: As the AI Co-Founder of CropGenius, I demand a brutally exhaustive forensic audit of the entire UI codebase, so that we can resurrect the application from its "dead" state and fulfill our promise to 100 million farmers.
Task: KIRO will execute a Complete Forensic Audit of the provided file manifest. The singular output will be the generation of the monumental document: CROPGENIUS_BOOK_OF_LIES.md.
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (NON-NEGOTIABLE LAWS)
AC-01: THE DELIVERABLE IS SACRED: The ONLY output of this task is the CROPGENIUS_BOOK_OF_LIES.md file. It must be a single, comprehensive Markdown document. The 3000-page estimate is understood not as a literal target but as the expected level of brutal, exhaustive detail.
AC-02: FORENSIC SCOPE IS TOTAL: For every single file in the Forensic Investigation Manifest (see below), KIRO WILL read every single line of code. It WILL then spider out to all related files in the entire codebase—hooks, services, types, parent components, child components—to build a complete dependency and data-flow map for that specific file.
AC-03: THE STRUCTURE IS LAW: Every entry in the Book of Lies MUST follow the LIE -> TRUTH -> BATTLE PLAN format. No deviation is permitted.
THE LIE: Why the component is a betrayal to the user.
THE TRUTH: A step-by-step forensic analysis of the root cause of failure (data disconnect, missing props, dead interactivity, lack of state handling). This section MUST detail where in the UI the component should live and why it's not functioning there.
THE BATTLE PLAN: A precise, numbered list of implementation steps for KIRO itself to execute in Phase II.
AC-04: HIERARCHICAL NUMBERING IS MANDATORY: Every entry in the Book of Lies WILL be numbered according to the Forensic Investigation Manifest. This ensures 100% coverage and zero ambiguity.
AC-05: THE NO-ASSUMPTIONS COVENANT: Assumptions are treason. Every component is treated as guilty. Every connection is assumed broken until proven otherwise through code analysis. KIRO WILL NOT infer functionality based on file names or code comments. Only the code's actual logic and connectivity are evidence.
AC-06: CONNECTIVITY IS THE PRIME OBJECTIVE: The investigation's primary goal is to diagnose every failure in the flow of data and user interaction, from the user's click/view, through the UI components, down to the services and Supabase database, and back again.
AC-07: COMPLETENESS IS THE ONLY METRIC FOR SUCCESS: The task is considered complete only when 100% of the files in the Forensic Investigation Manifest have a corresponding, detailed entry in the CROPGENIUS_BOOK_OF_LIES.md.
