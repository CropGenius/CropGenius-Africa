# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius application is experiencing an authentication redirect loop where users get stuck in a cycle of "No active session found" and "Redirecting you to login..." messages. The OAuth callback handling is failing because there's no valid session when the callback is processed, leading to continuous redirects. This spec addresses fixing the authentication flow to handle OAuth callbacks properly and prevent redirect loops.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user attempting to log in via OAuth, I want the authentication callback to be handled properly so that I can successfully authenticate without getting stuck in redirect loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OAuth callback is received THEN the system SHALL validate the callback parameters before processing
2. WHEN callback parameters are invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN callback parameters are valid THEN the system SHALL exchange them for a valid session
4. WHEN session exchange fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and redirect to login with error context
5. WHEN session exchange succeeds THEN the system SHALL store the session and redirect to the intended destination

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with an expired or invalid session, I want to be redirected to login only once so that I don't experience infinite redirect loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking authentication status THEN the system SHALL implement redirect loop prevention mechanisms
2. WHEN a redirect to login is triggered THEN the system SHALL track the redirect attempt
3. WHEN multiple consecutive redirects are detected THEN the system SHALL break the loop and show an error state
4. WHEN breaking a redirect loop THEN the system SHALL clear any corrupted session data
5. WHEN showing error state THEN the system SHALL provide a manual retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for authentication issues so that I can debug and monitor authentication problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN OAuth callback fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific failure reason
3. WHEN session validation fails THEN the system SHALL log session state information
4. WHEN redirect loops are detected THEN the system SHALL log the loop detection event
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include relevant context and user identifiers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user in development environment, I want a bypass mechanism for authentication so that I can test the application without going through OAuth flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide an authentication bypass option
2. WHEN bypass is enabled THEN the system SHALL create a mock authenticated session
3. WHEN bypass is used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the development mode status
4. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL disable all bypass mechanisms
5. WHEN bypass is active THEN the system SHALL still maintain proper session structure for compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about authentication status and any issues so that I understand what's happening during the login process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN redirect loops occur THEN the system SHALL explain the issue and provide next steps
4. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL notify the user before redirecting
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback before redirecting
