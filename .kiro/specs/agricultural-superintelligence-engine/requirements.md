# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CropGenius Agricultural Superintelligence Engine represents the next evolutionary leap in precision agriculture technology. This system will transform CropGenius from a farming app into an autonomous agricultural intelligence that operates at the level of a dedicated team of world-class agronomists, meteorologists, market analysts, and agricultural scientists for every farmer. The engine will provide real-time, context-aware, predictive agricultural intelligence that adapts to each farmer's unique conditions, crops, and goals.

2. WHEN weather forecasts are updated THEN the system SHALL predict disease and pest risks for the next 14 days
3. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL forecast optimal selling windows with price predictions
4. WHEN planting season approaches THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal crop varieties based on predicted conditions
5. IF prediction confidence is below 80% THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty and provide alternative scenarios

### Requirement 3: Autonomous Agent Orchestration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want multiple AI agents working together seamlessly to provide comprehensive agricultural intelligence, so that I get holistic recommendations that consider all aspects of farming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field issue is detected THEN multiple agents SHALL collaborate to provide integrated solutions
2. WHEN agents have conflicting recommendations THEN the system SHALL use consensus algorithms to provide unified advice
3. WHEN new data arrives THEN all relevant agents SHALL automatically update their analyses and recommendations
4. WHEN user preferences change THEN all agents SHALL adapt their recommendations accordingly
5. IF an agent fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with degraded but functional intelligence

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Market Intelligence Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want real-time market intelligence integrated with my field data, so that I can optimize both production and selling decisions simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crop maturity is detected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time market prices and selling recommendations
2. WHEN market prices fluctuate significantly THEN the system SHALL alert farmers with actionable advice
3. WHEN harvest timing is flexible THEN the system SHALL optimize harvest dates for maximum profit
4. WHEN storage options are available THEN the system SHALL calculate optimal storage vs immediate sale decisions
5. IF market data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use historical patterns and provide confidence intervals

### Requirement 5: Contextual Learning and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to learn from my specific conditions and preferences, so that recommendations become more accurate and personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL update its models to improve future recommendations
2. WHEN local conditions differ from general patterns THEN the system SHALL adapt recommendations to local context
3. WHEN farming practices succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL learn and adjust future advice
4. WHEN seasonal patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into predictive models
5. IF user behavior patterns change THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to new preferences

### Requirement 6: Multi-Modal Intelligence Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to integrate visual, textual, and sensor data seamlessly, so that I can interact with it naturally through multiple channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL analyze them and integrate findings with other data sources
2. WHEN voice commands are given THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate actions and confirmations
3. WHEN text messages are sent THEN the system SHALL understand context and provide relevant responses
4. WHEN sensor data is received THEN the system SHALL correlate it with visual and textual information
5. IF communication channels fail THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality through available channels

### Requirement 7: Autonomous Decision Support System

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to provide decision support that considers my goals, constraints, and resources, so that recommendations are practical and achievable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource constraints are defined THEN the system SHALL only recommend feasible actions
2. WHEN multiple goals conflict THEN the system SHALL provide trade-off analysis and optimization options
3. WHEN urgent decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL prioritize time-sensitive recommendations
4. WHEN long-term planning is required THEN the system SHALL provide strategic roadmaps with milestones
5. IF user capacity is limited THEN the system SHALL suggest the highest-impact actions first

### Requirement 8: Continuous Intelligence Pipeline

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to continuously process and analyze data in the background, so that intelligence is always current and actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data arrives THEN the system SHALL process it within 5 minutes and update recommendations
2. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert on persistent failures
3. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them and request clarification
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical analyses and defer non-urgent processing
5. IF data sources become unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with cached data and indicate staleness

### Requirement 9: Scalable Intelligence Architecture

**User Story:** As the platform grows, I want the intelligence system to maintain performance and accuracy, so that service quality remains consistent regardless of user base size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user base doubles THEN system response time SHALL remain under 2 seconds for 95% of requests
2. WHEN data volume increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale processing capacity
3. WHEN new regions are added THEN the system SHALL adapt to local agricultural practices and conditions
4. WHEN new crop types are introduced THEN the system SHALL learn and provide relevant intelligence
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade non-critical features

### Requirement 10: Explainable AI and Trust Building
