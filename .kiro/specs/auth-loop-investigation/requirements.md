# Auth Loop Investigation - Critical System Failure

## Introduction

We have a CRITICAL auth loop causing millions in losses. This investigation will follow aviation crash investigation methodology to identify root cause and implement bulletproof solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Root Cause Analysis

**User Story:** As a crash investigator, I need to identify the exact sequence of events causing the auth loop, so that I can eliminate the failure point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating the auth flow THEN I SHALL trace every component interaction
2. WHEN analyzing the Protected component THEN I SHALL identify all state dependencies  
3. WHEN examining useAuth hook THEN I SHALL verify authentication state management
4. WHEN checking Auth page THEN I SHALL confirm redirect logic
5. WHEN reviewing OnboardingPage THEN I SHALL validate completion flow

### Requirement 2: Component Interaction Mapping

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I need to map all component interactions in the auth flow, so that I can identify circular dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping AppRoutes THEN I SHALL document all route conditions
2. WHEN analyzing Protected component THEN I SHALL trace all useEffect dependencies
3. WHEN examining AuthProvider THEN I SHALL verify state propagation
4. WHEN checking navigation logic THEN I SHALL identify potential loops

### Requirement 3: State Management Audit

**User Story:** As a debugging expert, I need to audit all authentication state changes, so that I can identify race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user signs in THEN authentication state SHALL update correctly
2. WHEN onboarding completes THEN user profile state SHALL persist
3. WHEN checking onboarding status THEN database queries SHALL not cause loops
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN state SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 4: Loop Prevention Solution

**User Story:** As a system architect, I need to implement bulletproof loop prevention, so that users never get stuck in auth loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing auth flow THEN it SHALL have maximum 1 redirect per user action
2. WHEN user completes onboarding THEN they SHALL go directly to dashboard
3. WHEN existing user signs in THEN they SHALL bypass onboarding completely
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN user SHALL get clear path forward

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I need comprehensive test scenarios, so that I can verify the auth loop is permanently eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing new user flow THEN it SHALL complete without loops
2. WHEN testing existing user flow THEN it SHALL complete without loops  
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN they SHALL not cause loops
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN system SHALL remain stable
