# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Cleanup Automation feature will provide automated identification and removal of unused code throughout the CropGenius application. This system will help maintain a clean, efficient codebase by actively detecting dead code, unused imports, commented-out blocks, and unreachable conditions. The feature will prioritize code elimination while ensuring safety through dependency analysis and verification before deletion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically identify unused code components, so that I can maintain a clean and efficient codebase without manual scanning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans the codebase THEN it SHALL identify unused React components, hooks, utilities, and services
2. WHEN the system detects unused imports THEN it SHALL flag them for removal
3. WHEN the system finds commented-out code blocks THEN it SHALL identify them as candidates for deletion
4. WHEN the system encounters unreachable code conditions THEN it SHALL mark them for cleanup
5. IF a file has no active imports or references THEN the system SHALL classify it as orphaned

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency analysis before code removal, so that I can ensure no subtle dependencies are broken when cleaning up code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is marked for deletion THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive dependency analysis
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL check for direct imports and references
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL check for dynamic imports and string-based references
4. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify no test files depend on the code
5. IF any dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL prevent automatic deletion and flag for manual review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated cleanup execution with safety checks, so that I can remove dead code without breaking the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing cleanup THEN the system SHALL create a backup of affected files
2. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL update related import statements automatically
3. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL run build verification to ensure no breakage
4. IF build verification fails THEN the system SHALL automatically restore from backup
5. WHEN cleanup succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report of changes made

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable cleanup rules and exclusions, so that I can customize the cleanup behavior for my project's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring cleanup THEN the system SHALL allow exclusion patterns for files and directories
2. WHEN configuring cleanup THEN the system SHALL allow whitelisting of specific unused exports
3. WHEN configuring cleanup THEN the system SHALL support different aggressiveness levels for cleanup
4. WHEN configuring cleanup THEN the system SHALL allow scheduling of automatic cleanup runs
5. IF no configuration exists THEN the system SHALL use safe default settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed reporting and rollback capabilities, so that I can review cleanup actions and undo changes if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report of all changes
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include file paths, line counts removed, and reasoning
3. WHEN cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain a rollback history for recent changes
4. WHEN rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL restore files to their pre-cleanup state
5. WHEN displaying reports THEN the system SHALL show potential impact on bundle size and performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with the existing development workflow, so that code cleanup happens seamlessly as part of my regular development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL optionally run cleanup analysis
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL provide cleanup suggestions as comments
3. WHEN the development server runs THEN the system SHALL optionally show cleanup notifications
4. WHEN cleanup suggestions exist THEN the system SHALL integrate with the IDE's problem panel
5. IF cleanup is configured for CI/CD THEN the system SHALL run as part of the build pipeline
