# Weather System Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

The current weather dashboard is experiencing critical failures where the UI appears dead with empty tabs and no weather data display. This spec addresses the complete redesign and resurrection of the weather intelligence system to provide farmers with reliable, real-time weather insights for their fields.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Weather Data Display Foundation

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to see current weather conditions for my location immediately when I open the weather dashboard, so that I can make informed farming decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the weather dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current weather data within 3 seconds
2. WHEN no user fields are configured THEN the system SHALL display demo weather data for a default location (Nairobi, Kenya)
3. WHEN the weather API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to demo data seamlessly
4. WHEN weather data loads THEN the system SHALL display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition
5. IF a user has configured fields THEN the system SHALL automatically select the first field for weather display

### Requirement 2: Field-Based Weather Intelligence

**User Story:** As a farmer with multiple fields, I want to select different fields and see location-specific weather data, so that I can manage each field appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has multiple fields THEN the system SHALL provide a field selector dropdown
2. WHEN a user selects a field THEN the system SHALL update weather data to match the field's coordinates
3. WHEN field coordinates are available THEN the system SHALL use latitude/longitude for precise weather data
4. WHEN field coordinates are missing THEN the system SHALL use a default location with clear indication
5. WHEN switching between fields THEN weather data SHALL update within 2 seconds

### Requirement 3: Multi-Tab Weather Interface

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to access different types of weather information through organized tabs, so that I can quickly find the specific weather insights I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display three main tabs: Overview, 7-Day Forecast, and Insights
2. WHEN the Overview tab is active THEN the system SHALL show current weather conditions and field-specific data
3. WHEN the 7-Day Forecast tab is active THEN the system SHALL display detailed daily forecasts with farming recommendations
4. WHEN the Insights tab is active THEN the system SHALL show AI-powered farming recommendations based on weather patterns
5. WHEN switching tabs THEN the content SHALL load immediately without additional API calls

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a farmer in areas with unreliable internet, I want the weather dashboard to always show some weather information, so that I'm never left without weather guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weather API fails THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to demo mode with realistic weather data
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL use cached weather data if available
3. WHEN no cached data exists THEN the system SHALL display demo weather data with clear indication
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL still provide weather functionality using demo fields
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5: Weather Service Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified weather service that handles all weather data operations, so that the system is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather data is requested THEN the UnifiedWeatherService SHALL handle all API calls and caching
2. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the service SHALL cache data for 15 minutes to reduce API usage
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the service SHALL return demo data without throwing errors
4. WHEN demo data is used THEN the service SHALL clearly indicate the data source
5. WHEN clearing cache THEN the service SHALL allow location-specific or complete cache clearing

### Requirement 6: User Experience and Performance

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the weather dashboard to load quickly and provide a smooth experience, so that I can efficiently check weather conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the initial render SHALL complete within 1 second
2. WHEN weather data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN data updates THEN the interface SHALL update smoothly without jarring transitions
4. WHEN using the dashboard THEN all interactions SHALL feel responsive and immediate
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the dashboard SHALL be fully functional and touch-friendly

### Requirement 7: Data Integration and Persistence

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want my weather preferences and field selections to be remembered, so that I have a consistent experience across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a field THEN the system SHALL remember this selection for future visits
2. WHEN weather data is fetched THEN the system SHALL optionally save historical data to Supabase
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL load their actual fields from the database
4. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality with demo data
5. WHEN field data changes THEN the weather display SHALL update automatically
