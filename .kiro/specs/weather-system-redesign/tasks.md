# Weather System Redesign - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan converts the weather system design into discrete, manageable coding steps that build incrementally toward a fully functional weather dashboard. Each task focuses on specific code implementation that can be executed by a coding agent.

## Implementation Tasks

  - Create fallback UI when weather data is unavailable



  - Ensure weather alerts component integrates properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 6.2_

- [ ] 6. Implement WeatherForecastPanel with demo data support
  - Create 7-day forecast display with proper data handling
  - Implement hourly forecast breakdown for selected days
  - Add farm-specific recommendations based on weather conditions
  - Ensure forecast panel works with both API and demo data
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Create weather insights and recommendations system
  - Implement AI-powered farming recommendations based on weather patterns
  - Create weather impact analysis for different farming activities
  - Add urgency indicators for weather-related farm actions
  - Integrate crop-specific recommendations when field crop data is available
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Add error boundaries around weather components
  - Create user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed weather data requests
  - Add clear indicators when demo data is being used
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Add weather data caching and performance optimization
  - Implement memory caching with 15-minute TTL in UnifiedWeatherService
  - Add cache invalidation for manual refresh operations
  - Optimize component re-renders during weather data updates

  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.5, 6.1, 6.4_

- [ ] 10. Create responsive weather dashboard layout
  - Implement mobile-friendly weather dashboard layout
  - Add responsive grid system for weather cards and panels
  - Ensure touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices
  - Optimize weather icons and graphics for different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 6.5_

- [ ] 11. Implement weather data persistence and user preferences
  - Add field selection persistence across browser sessions
  - Implement optional weather data saving to Supabase for authenticated users
  - Create user preference system for weather units and display options
  - Add historical weather data tracking when user is authenticated
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.5_

- [ ] 12. Add comprehensive weather component testing
  - Write unit tests for UnifiedWeatherService with mock API responses
  - Create tests for useWeatherData hook covering all error scenarios
