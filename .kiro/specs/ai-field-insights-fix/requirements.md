# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Field Insights feature is currently completely non-functional, showing fake placeholder data instead of calling the fully operational AI backend. This feature is critical for providing 100 million African farmers with real AI-powered field analysis and crop recommendations using Gemini AI integration. The investigation has revealed that while a sophisticated AI backend exists with 1309 lines of production-ready code, the frontend is completely disconnected from it, returning hardcoded fallback data instead of real AI insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an African farmer, I want to receive real AI-powered field analysis and crop recommendations, so that I can make informed agricultural decisions based on actual satellite data and machine learning insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my field details THEN the system SHALL call the real field-ai-insights Edge Function instead of showing placeholder data
2. WHEN the AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display actual Gemini AI recommendations instead of hardcoded fallback text
3. WHEN satellite data is available THEN the system SHALL include NDVI, EVI, and SAVI analysis in the recommendations
4. WHEN disease risk analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL provide ML-based predictions specific to my field conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want proper error handling when AI analysis fails, so that I understand what went wrong instead of seeing fake placeholder data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
2. WHEN the AI service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a retry option instead of fake recommendations
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication instead of showing placeholder data
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL indicate the specific problem and suggest solutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the crop recommendations feature to use the same AI backend, so that I receive consistent and accurate agricultural insights across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request crop recommendations THEN the system SHALL call the field-ai-insights function instead of the separate crop-recommendations function
2. WHEN AI insights are generated THEN the system SHALL transform them appropriately for the crop recommendations interface
3. WHEN multiple AI features are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency in data sources and analysis methods
4. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve AI insights efficiently to improve performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database integration for AI insights, so that recommendations can be stored, retrieved, and analyzed for system improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI insights are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in the appropriate database table
2. WHEN the crop_recommendations table is accessed THEN the system SHALL find an existing table structure instead of encountering missing table errors
3. WHEN field insights are stored THEN the system SHALL use the existing field_insights table properly
4. WHEN AI service logs are needed THEN the system SHALL utilize the ai_service_logs table for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want fast and responsive AI analysis, so that I can quickly get the insights I need without long waiting times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request AI analysis THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis in under 3 seconds for optimal user experience
2. WHEN loading states are shown THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful progress indicators instead of generic loading messages
3. WHEN AI analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show specific status updates about the analysis stages
4. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL display them immediately without additional delays

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want Africa-specific agricultural recommendations, so that the AI insights are relevant to my local farming conditions and challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL consider African climate patterns and agricultural practices
2. WHEN crop recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL prioritize crops suitable for African growing conditions
3. WHEN disease risk assessment is conducted THEN the system SHALL focus on diseases common in African agricultural regions
4. WHEN soil analysis is provided THEN the system SHALL account for typical African soil types and characteristics
