# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius Platform Audit and Optimization feature is a comprehensive system-wide assessment and improvement initiative designed to enhance the agricultural intelligence platform serving 100 million African farmers. This audit encompasses debugging, performance optimization, security hardening, and functionality verification across all critical agricultural features including crop disease detection, weather forecasting, market intelligence, and satellite field analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System-Wide Health & Performance Audit

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive system health monitoring and performance optimization, so that farmers experience fast, reliable access to agricultural intelligence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system audit is initiated THEN the platform SHALL assess frontend state management response times with metrics below 200ms for critical user interactions
2. WHEN backend API performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve latency issues ensuring response times under 500ms for agricultural data queries
3. WHEN database performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL optimize query execution times and implement structured error logging with 99.9% uptime
4. WHEN data contracts are validated THEN the system SHALL ensure 100% accuracy and reliability between frontend and backend agricultural data exchanges
5. IF performance bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL implement automated optimization recommendations and monitoring alerts

### Requirement 2: Agricultural Intelligence Feature Deep Dive

**User Story:** As a smallholder farmer, I want all agricultural intelligence features to work accurately and reliably, so that I can make informed decisions about my crops and farming practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crop disease detection is tested THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.7% accuracy using PlantNet + Gemini AI integration
2. WHEN weather forecasting is validated THEN the system SHALL provide hyper-local agricultural weather insights with 95% accuracy for 7-day forecasts
3. WHEN market price intelligence is verified THEN the system SHALL deliver real-time market data with less than 1-hour latency for optimal selling decisions
4. WHEN satellite intelligence is assessed THEN the system SHALL provide accurate NDVI analysis and yield predictions using Sentinel Hub API
5. WHEN user interactions are tested THEN the system SHALL ensure locality-based insights and actionable recommendations for African farming contexts
6. IF any agricultural feature fails THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and offline fallback capabilities

### Requirement 3: Security & Scalability Hardening Protocol

**User Story:** As a platform security officer, I want comprehensive security measures and scalability assurance, so that user data is protected and the platform can handle increased traffic from millions of farmers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulnerability scanning is performed THEN the system SHALL identify and remediate all critical and high-severity security issues
2. WHEN user data protection is evaluated THEN the system SHALL implement end-to-end encryption and secure API key management
3. WHEN load testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL handle 10,000 concurrent users with less than 2% error rate
4. WHEN scalability analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate capacity for 100 million user growth with auto-scaling capabilities
5. WHEN authentication security is tested THEN the system SHALL ensure secure Google OAuth integration and session management
6. IF security vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL implement immediate patches and continuous monitoring

### Requirement 4: Final Verification & Post-Fix Confirmation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing protocols and verification systems, so that all fixes and optimizations are validated without introducing new issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated testing is executed THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive test suites covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
2. WHEN manual testing is performed THEN the system SHALL validate critical user journeys for disease detection, weather insights, and market intelligence
3. WHEN regression testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL ensure no new issues are introduced post-deployment
4. WHEN performance verification is completed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable improvements in response times and system stability
5. WHEN user acceptance testing is performed THEN the system SHALL achieve 95% user satisfaction scores for core agricultural features
6. IF any post-fix issues are detected THEN the system SHALL implement immediate rollback procedures and issue resolution protocols

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Reporting Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a platform operations team member, I want detailed audit reports and ongoing monitoring capabilities, so that I can track system health and implement continuous improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit phases are completed THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with findings, resolutions, and performance metrics
2. WHEN monitoring dashboards are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide real-time visibility into system health, user engagement, and agricultural feature performance
3. WHEN alerting systems are configured THEN the system SHALL notify operations teams of critical issues within 5 minutes of detection
4. WHEN performance baselines are established THEN the system SHALL track improvements with before/after metrics for all optimization efforts
5. WHEN recommendation systems are deployed THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights for ongoing platform improvements
6. IF system degradation is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger investigation protocols and escalation procedures
