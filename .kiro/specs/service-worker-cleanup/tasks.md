  - Add event handlers for install, activate, fetch, and message events
  - Ensure cache cleanup and update mechanisms work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Create simple service worker registration utility


  - Implement registration function with environment detection
  - Add unregistration function for emergency cleanup
  - Include error handling that doesn't break app functionality
  - Ensure production-only registration with proper logging
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 4. Build minimal React hook for service worker integration


  - Create hook with maximum 40 lines and 3 essential states
  - Implement update detection and application functionality
  - Add automatic registration in production environment
  - Include error boundary protection for reliability
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Integrate service worker registration in main application entry point


  - Update main.tsx to use new registration utility
  - Remove old service worker registration calls
  - Ensure single registration point for the entire application
  - Test that registration occurs after React app initialization
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 6. Update components using old service worker implementations



  - Find and update all components importing old service worker hooks
  - Replace old hook usage with new minimal implementation

  - Ensure no breaking changes to component functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive testing for service worker functionality
  - Create unit tests for service worker registration utility
  - Add tests for React hook state management and updates
  - Test offline functionality and cache serving behavior
  - Verify PWA installation and update mechanisms work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2_



- [x] 9. Validate hash routing and Google OAuth functionality
