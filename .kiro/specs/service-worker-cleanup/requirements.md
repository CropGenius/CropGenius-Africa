# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CropGenius has suffered a catastrophic service worker failure caused by over-engineering, duplicate implementations, and conflicting registration logic. The system currently has 11 duplicate service worker files totaling 1,880+ lines of code for basic caching functionality, causing hash routing issues that block users from accessing the application and resulting in lost advertising revenue. This feature will implement an emergency reconstruction plan to reduce complexity by 93% and restore reliable service worker functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want the application to load reliably without hash routing issues, so that I can access all features and functionality without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits https://cropgenius.africa/ THEN the application SHALL load without falling back to hash routing
2. WHEN the service worker is registered THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with React Router navigation
3. WHEN multiple users access the application simultaneously THEN there SHALL be no routing conflicts
4. WHEN Google OAuth redirects occur THEN they SHALL work correctly without service worker interference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, minimal service worker implementation, so that I can maintain the caching functionality without complexity and conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be exactly 3 service worker related files totaling less than 150 lines
2. WHEN implementing caching logic THEN the service worker SHALL be maximum 50 lines of code
3. WHEN registering the service worker THEN there SHALL be only one registration utility with maximum 30 lines
4. WHEN integrating with React THEN there SHALL be only one hook with maximum 40 lines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all duplicate and conflicting service worker files removed, so that there are no registration conflicts or cache strategy interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all duplicate service worker hooks SHALL be deleted (useServiceWorkerV2.ts, useServiceWorker.old.ts, useServiceWorker.new.ts)
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all duplicate registration utilities SHALL be deleted (serviceWorkerRegistration.new.ts)
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all duplicate service worker files SHALL be deleted (public/sw.js)
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the broken registerServiceWorker function in sw-utils.ts SHALL be removed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want offline functionality to work reliably, so that I can continue using cached features when my internet connection is poor or unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user goes offline THEN static assets SHALL be served from cache
2. WHEN the user is offline THEN the application SHALL provide appropriate offline fallbacks
3. WHEN the user comes back online THEN cache updates SHALL occur seamlessly
4. WHEN cache storage reaches capacity THEN old cache entries SHALL be cleaned up automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want PWA installation to work correctly, so that I can install CropGenius as a native-like app on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile user visits the application THEN PWA installation prompts SHALL appear when appropriate
2. WHEN the user installs the PWA THEN it SHALL function correctly with proper caching
3. WHEN the PWA is installed THEN updates SHALL be handled gracefully without breaking functionality
4. WHEN the service worker updates THEN users SHALL be notified and able to apply updates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the service worker to only register in production, so that development workflow is not affected by caching issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the service worker SHALL NOT register
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN the service worker SHALL register automatically
3. WHEN the service worker fails to register THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally
4. WHEN service worker registration occurs THEN it SHALL be logged for monitoring purposes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want zero revenue loss due to service worker issues, so that advertising income and user engagement remain stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the application THEN the success rate SHALL be greater than 99.9%
2. WHEN Google OAuth is used THEN the success rate SHALL be greater than 99%
3. WHEN service worker issues occur THEN they SHALL NOT prevent users from accessing core functionality
4. WHEN monitoring the application THEN service worker related errors SHALL be less than 1% of total requests
