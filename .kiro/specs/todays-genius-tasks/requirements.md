# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "Today's Genius Tasks" system is the AI-powered daily command center for farmers - the first thing they see when opening CropGenius. This feature transforms raw agricultural data (weather, field conditions, crop stages, market prices) into personalized, actionable daily tasks that maximize farm profitability and sustainability. The system acts as the farmer's "morning brain," providing intelligent prioritization of daily activities based on real-time conditions and long-term farm goals.

2. WHEN the system generates daily tasks THEN it SHALL include 3-7 actionable tasks prioritized by impact and urgency
3. WHEN displaying tasks THEN each task SHALL include title, description, expected impact, priority level, and estimated time
4. WHEN no tasks can be generated THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful fallback message with general farming guidance
5. WHEN the user has no fields configured THEN the system SHALL prioritize onboarding tasks to set up their first field

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want my daily tasks to be based on real-time weather and field conditions, so that I can respond appropriately to changing agricultural conditions.

2. WHEN field data indicates specific growth stages THEN the system SHALL suggest stage-appropriate activities
3. WHEN multiple fields exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize tasks across fields based on urgency and impact
4. WHEN field-specific issues are detected THEN the system SHALL generate targeted remediation tasks
5. WHEN seasonal timing is optimal for specific crops THEN the system SHALL suggest time-sensitive activities
