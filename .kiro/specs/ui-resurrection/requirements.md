# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CropGenius has a powerful backend infrastructure and 150+ UI components built in `src/components/`, but the UI is currently non-functional with components existing as isolated fragments without proper integration, routing, or data connections. This feature will systematically audit every component, identify missing connections, and resurrect the UI into a fully functional, production-ready interface that serves as the visual gateway to CropGenius's agricultural intelligence platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CropGenius developer, I want a comprehensive audit of all UI components, so that I can understand what exists, what's broken, and what needs to be connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component audit is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan every file in `src/components/` recursively
2. WHEN each component is analyzed THEN the system SHALL determine if it is properly exported, imported, and integrated into the application
3. WHEN a component is found to be disconnected THEN the system SHALL document its intended purpose, missing connections, and required data sources
4. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a "Components Pages Book of Lies" document containing the status of every component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want all UI components to be properly connected to their data sources and APIs, so that I can interact with a fully functional agricultural intelligence platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component requires Supabase data THEN the system SHALL establish proper database connections with Row Level Security
2. WHEN a component needs authentication state THEN the system SHALL connect it to the auth provider and user session
3. WHEN a component displays real-time data THEN the system SHALL wire it to Supabase real-time subscriptions
4. WHEN a component calls external APIs THEN the system SHALL connect it to the appropriate service layer (weather, satellite, AI agents)
5. WHEN a component handles user input THEN the system SHALL implement proper form validation and error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want a complete navigation system and page routing, so that I can access all features of the agricultural platform through an intuitive interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a functional home page with navigation
2. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth routing between Dashboard, Onboarding, Farm Intelligence, Disease Detection, AI Chat, Weather Intelligence, and Pro Upgrade pages
3. WHEN I access a page THEN the system SHALL render all relevant components with proper layouts and data
4. WHEN I use mobile navigation THEN the system SHALL provide thumb-zone optimized, one-handed operation patterns
5. WHEN I am offline THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation functionality with cached content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CropGenius farmer, I want access to core agricultural intelligence features through the UI, so that I can manage my farm operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display field mapping, crop health status, weather forecasts, and market intelligence
2. WHEN I use disease detection THEN the system SHALL provide camera integration, AI analysis, and treatment recommendations
3. WHEN I interact with the AI chat THEN the system SHALL connect to farming agents and provide contextual agricultural advice
4. WHEN I view field intelligence THEN the system SHALL display satellite imagery, NDVI analysis, and yield predictions
5. WHEN I check market data THEN the system SHALL show real-time pricing and optimal selling recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CropGenius developer, I want a systematic implementation plan for UI resurrection, so that components can be connected and tested incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing component connections THEN the system SHALL follow a prioritized order based on user journey importance
2. WHEN connecting components THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries and fallback states
3. WHEN wiring data sources THEN the system SHALL use React Query for caching and offline-first patterns
4. WHEN testing connections THEN the system SHALL verify each component renders correctly with real data
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure mobile-responsive, PWA-compatible, and production-ready UI

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want the UI to maintain the premium glassmorphism design system, so that the interface feels modern and professional while being accessible on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply consistent glassmorphism styling with backdrop blur effects
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use the established design tokens and color system
3. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure 44px minimum touch targets and thumb-zone navigation
4. WHEN animations occur THEN the system SHALL use Framer Motion for smooth micro-interactions
5. WHEN accessibility is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG compliance while preserving visual design

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a CropGenius administrator, I want comprehensive documentation of the UI resurrection process, so that future development can build upon this foundation systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are audited THEN the system SHALL maintain a living "Components Pages Book of Lies" document
2. WHEN connections are made THEN the system SHALL document the wiring patterns and integration approaches
3. WHEN issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL update the documentation with solutions and implementation notes
4. WHEN the resurrection is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable process for future component integration
5. WHEN new components are added THEN the system SHALL enable running the same audit and integration process
