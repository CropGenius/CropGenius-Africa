# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius authentication system is experiencing a critical PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow failure that prevents users from completing Google OAuth sign-in. The error "invalid request: both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty" indicates that while the authorization code is successfully returned from Google, the code verifier required for PKCE is missing during the token exchange process. This spec addresses the complete resolution of the PKCE flow to restore OAuth functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to complete Google OAuth sign-in without PKCE code verifier errors, so that I can successfully authenticate and access the CropGenius platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL properly generate and store a PKCE code verifier
2. WHEN the OAuth callback is processed THEN the system SHALL successfully retrieve the stored code verifier
3. WHEN the token exchange occurs THEN both the authorization code and code verifier SHALL be present and valid
4. WHEN the PKCE flow completes THEN the user SHALL be authenticated and redirected to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust PKCE code verifier storage and retrieval, so that the OAuth flow works consistently across different browser environments and storage scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OAuth flow starts THEN the code verifier SHALL be stored with a unique, collision-resistant key
2. WHEN localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback storage mechanisms
3. WHEN the callback occurs THEN the system SHALL retrieve the correct code verifier using the state parameter
4. WHEN the flow completes THEN the stored code verifier SHALL be cleaned up to prevent storage bloat

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive PKCE flow debugging and monitoring, so that authentication issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PKCE flow starts THEN the system SHALL log code verifier generation and storage
2. WHEN the callback is processed THEN the system SHALL log code verifier retrieval attempts
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific PKCE-related error messages
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL show step-by-step PKCE flow progress

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to handle PKCE flow edge cases gracefully, so that temporary storage issues don't prevent me from signing in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code verifier storage fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to implicit flow or retry
2. WHEN code verifier retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and recovery options
3. WHEN browser storage is cleared mid-flow THEN the system SHALL detect this and restart the flow
4. WHEN multiple OAuth attempts occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent flows without conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible OAuth flow configuration, so that the system can adapt to different deployment environments and security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PKCE flow is problematic THEN the system SHALL support switching to implicit flow
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL respect OAuth flow type preferences
3. WHEN security policies require it THEN the system SHALL enforce PKCE flow exclusively
4. WHEN testing locally THEN the system SHALL provide development-friendly OAuth configurations
