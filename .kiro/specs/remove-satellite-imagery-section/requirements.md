# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely removing the satellite imagery/satellite field section from the CropGenius homescreen. The satellite imagery display currently takes up significant screen real estate and the user wants it completely removed to simplify the interface and focus on other core features like field management and daily actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want the satellite imagery section removed from the homescreen, so that I have a cleaner interface focused on my fields and daily actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I visit the homescreen THEN the "Satellite Field Intelligence" card SHALL not be displayed
3. WHEN I visit the homescreen THEN the SatelliteImageryDisplay component SHALL not be rendered
4. WHEN I visit the homescreen THEN the space previously occupied by satellite imagery SHALL be reclaimed
5. WHEN I visit the homescreen THEN all other sections (My Fields, Daily Organic Action Card) SHALL remain functional and properly positioned

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CropGenius user, I want the homescreen layout to automatically adjust after satellite imagery removal, so that there are no empty spaces or layout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the satellite imagery section is removed THEN the remaining components SHALL be properly spaced
2. WHEN the satellite imagery section is removed THEN there SHALL be no empty containers or divs left behind
3. WHEN the satellite imagery section is removed THEN the overall page layout SHALL remain visually balanced
4. WHEN the satellite imagery section is removed THEN the page SHALL maintain proper responsive behavior on mobile devices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the satellite imagery removal is clean, so that no unused code or dependencies remain in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN satellite imagery is removed THEN any unused imports related to SatelliteImageryDisplay SHALL be removed
2. WHEN satellite imagery is removed THEN any satellite-related conditional logic SHALL be cleaned up
3. WHEN satellite imagery is removed THEN the code SHALL remain maintainable and readable
