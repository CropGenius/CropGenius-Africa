# Satellite Intelligence System Requirements

## Introduction

The Satellite Intelligence System is a mission-critical component of CropGenius that provides real-time satellite-based field analysis to 100 million African farmers. This system transforms raw satellite imagery from multiple sources (Sentinel Hub, NASA MODIS, Landsat) into actionable agricultural intelligence that directly impacts farmer livelihoods, crop yields, and food security across Africa.

**Mission Statement**: Deliver professional-grade satellite intelligence that enables precision agriculture decisions for smallholder farmers, providing the same level of field analysis previously available only to large commercial operations.

5. WHEN precision agriculture opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL quantify ROI for variable rate applications
6. IF historical data exists THEN the system SHALL compare current performance to previous seasons

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Alert System

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive immediate alerts when critical issues are detected in my field, so that I can take urgent action to prevent crop loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN water stress is critical (moisture < 0.2) THEN the system SHALL generate immediate irrigation alerts
2. WHEN nutrient deficiency is detected (NDVI < 0.4 AND health < 0.5) THEN the system SHALL alert for soil testing
3. WHEN disease risk is high (health < 0.3) THEN the system SHALL recommend field scouting
4. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in the database with timestamps
5. WHEN critical alerts exist THEN the system SHALL integrate with WhatsApp/SMS notification services
6. IF multiple alerts exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize by severity and economic impact

### Requirement 6: Mobile-First User Experience

**User Story:** As a farmer using a low-spec Android phone in rural areas, I want fast, intuitive access to satellite intelligence, so that I can make field decisions even with limited connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN satellite analysis loads THEN the system SHALL display results within 3 seconds on 3G connections
2. WHEN imagery is processed THEN the system SHALL cache results for offline viewing
3. WHEN user interacts with maps THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly controls optimized for mobile
