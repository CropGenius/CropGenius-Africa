# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius application is experiencing issues with its error logging system, as evidenced by repeated failures to store error batches and missing database tables. This feature aims to implement a robust error logging system that properly captures, stores, and reports errors to help developers quickly identify and resolve issues in the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application errors to be properly logged so that I can identify and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an error occurs in any part of the application THEN the system SHALL capture the error details including message, stack trace, and context
2. WHEN an error is captured THEN the system SHALL store it in a persistent storage without throwing additional errors
3. WHEN multiple similar errors occur THEN the system SHALL aggregate them to prevent log flooding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a dedicated error_logs table in the database so that errors can be properly stored and analyzed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL ensure the error_logs table exists in the database
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL successfully store it in the error_logs table
3. WHEN the error_logs table is queried THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error information including timestamp, error type, message, and context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error logging system to be resilient to failures so that logging errors don't cause additional application issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the error logging system itself fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the failure without affecting the user experience
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue error logs for later submission
3. WHEN the error logging database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local storage or console logging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a support team member, I want access to a dashboard of application errors so that I can monitor system health and prioritize fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a summary of recent errors grouped by type and frequency
2. WHEN viewing error details THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide alerting mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want to be informed when errors occur so that I understand why certain features might not be working.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a non-critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message without technical details
2. WHEN a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to proceed or recover
3. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically restore functionality without requiring page refresh
