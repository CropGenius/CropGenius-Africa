# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius AI chat system currently experiences complete failure when streaming is enabled, causing the app to stop working and return no responses. This feature will implement proper streaming support for the Gemini 2.5 Flash API integration to provide real-time, incremental AI responses that improve user experience without breaking the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer using CropGenius, I want to see AI responses appear incrementally as they are generated, so that I get faster feedback and a more responsive chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the AI chat THEN the system SHALL stream the response incrementally without breaking the application
2. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN the system SHALL properly handle partial JSON chunks from the Gemini API
3. WHEN streaming responses are received THEN the UI SHALL update in real-time showing text as it arrives
4. WHEN a streaming request fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to non-streaming mode
5. WHEN streaming is active THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality including conversation history and context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining CropGenius, I want robust streaming implementation that handles edge cases, so that the system remains stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API endpoint doesn't support streaming THEN the system SHALL detect this and use non-streaming mode
2. WHEN network interruptions occur during streaming THEN the system SHALL handle partial responses gracefully
3. WHEN malformed JSON chunks are received THEN the system SHALL parse them correctly without crashing
4. WHEN streaming connections timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN buffer overflow occurs THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer using the mobile app, I want streaming to work seamlessly across different devices and network conditions, so that I get consistent performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on mobile devices THEN streaming SHALL work without additional latency
2. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL adapt streaming chunk sizes appropriately
3. WHEN switching between WiFi and mobile data THEN streaming SHALL continue without interruption
4. WHEN the device goes to sleep during streaming THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection properly
5. WHEN multiple users stream simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance for all users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities for streaming, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming requests are made THEN the system SHALL log detailed metrics including latency and chunk sizes
2. WHEN streaming errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information
4. WHEN streaming vs non-streaming performance is compared THEN the system SHALL provide comparative metrics
5. WHEN troubleshooting streaming issues THEN developers SHALL have access to request/response traces
