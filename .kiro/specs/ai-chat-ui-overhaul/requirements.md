# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current AI chat interface in CropGenius is a UX disaster that breaks user trust and feels like a foreign object within the app. This feature will completely redesign the chat UI to match WhatsApp-tier quality with consistent visual design, proper conversation flow, and lightning-fast perceived performance that leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash's speed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer using CropGenius, I want the AI chat interface to feel native and consistent with the rest of the app, so that I have confidence in the platform's quality and professionalism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the chat screen THEN the interface SHALL use the same universal background, padding, color palette, border radius, and elevation system as other CropGenius pages
2. WHEN comparing chat to Home, Scan, Weather pages THEN the visual consistency SHALL be immediately apparent with unified design language
3. WHEN the user interacts with chat elements THEN they SHALL follow the same grid system and spacing as the rest of the app
4. IF the user switches between different app sections THEN the transition SHALL feel seamless without cognitive dissonance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user on various Android devices, I want a compact and responsive input field that doesn't dominate my screen, so that I can focus on the conversation content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat loads THEN the input field SHALL have a default height of 48px matching native chat apps
2. WHEN the user types a long message THEN the input field SHALL expand dynamically up to 120px maximum height
3. WHEN the input field is displayed THEN it SHALL have rounded corners with 12px horizontal padding and 8px vertical padding
4. WHEN the user sees the input field THEN it SHALL have a subtle shadow consistent with the app's elevation system
5. IF the device has a small screen THEN the input field SHALL maintain proper proportions without overwhelming the interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer seeking AI assistance, I want AI responses formatted for quick scanning and comprehension, so that I can quickly extract actionable insights without cognitive overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI responds with information THEN it SHALL format content using bullet points for lists
2. WHEN the AI provides multi-part information THEN it SHALL use short sentences with clear section headlines
3. WHEN the AI response contains actionable items THEN it SHALL include relevant emojis or icons for visual scanning
4. WHEN the AI response exceeds 150 words THEN it SHALL split into multiple message bubbles with one main idea per bubble
5. IF the response contains technical information THEN it SHALL use formatting that enables quick skimming

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user engaging with AI assistance, I want smooth conversation animations and feedback, so that the interaction feels natural and responsive rather than mechanical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI is processing a response THEN the interface SHALL show typing dots animation
2. WHEN the AI is thinking THEN it SHALL display "CropGenius is thinking..." with an AI avatar indicator
3. WHEN a new message arrives THEN it SHALL auto-scroll smoothly to the new content
4. WHEN messages appear THEN they SHALL have a soft entry animation
5. IF the user sends a message THEN it SHALL appear immediately with send confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of a Gemini 2.5 Flash-powered system, I want to experience the model's lightning speed without any perceived delays, so that the AI feels instantaneous and powerful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN a placeholder response bubble SHALL appear immediately with "Let me check..." text
2. WHEN the AI is processing THEN the placeholder SHALL show partial typing animation until the real response arrives
3. WHEN the actual response is ready THEN it SHALL replace the placeholder seamlessly
4. WHEN the user experiences the chat THEN there SHALL be no blank silence periods between input and response indication
5. IF the response takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL maintain engagement with progressive loading states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer using CropGenius daily, I want the chat interface to feel like a professional tool rather than a demo, so that I trust it for critical farming decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the user compares the chat to other farming apps THEN it SHALL exceed their expectations for polish and usability
3. WHEN the user engages in conversation THEN the interface SHALL support extended use without fatigue

5. IF the user has used WhatsApp or iMessage THEN the CropGenius chat SHALL feel familiar and intuitive

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile-first farmer, I want the chat interface optimized for touch interaction and various screen sizes, so that I can use it effectively in field conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts on different screen sizes THEN the chat SHALL adapt responsively
2. WHEN the user taps interface elements THEN they SHALL have appropriate touch targets (minimum 44px)
3. WHEN the user scrolls through conversation history THEN it SHALL be smooth and performant
