# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Yield Predictor feature is currently providing users with dummy/mock responses instead of making actual API calls to Gemini 2.5 Flash for real AI-powered yield predictions. This creates a broken user experience where farmers receive fake predictions instead of genuine AI analysis. The feature needs to be completely overhauled to use the same Gemini 2.5 Flash integration pattern that works successfully in other features like the AI Crop Scanner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive real AI-powered yield predictions based on my actual farm data, so that I can make informed decisions about my crops and farming practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits farm data through the yield predictor form THEN the system SHALL make an actual API call to Gemini 2.5 Flash
2. WHEN the Gemini API call is successful THEN the system SHALL display real AI-generated predictions instead of mock data
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN the user provides field data (crop type, farm size, soil type, planting date, etc.) THEN the system SHALL include all relevant data in the Gemini prompt for accurate analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the yield predictor to use the same reliable AI technology as other CropGenius features, so that I can trust the consistency and accuracy of all AI predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the yield predictor makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the same Gemini 2.5 Flash configuration as the CropScanner
2. WHEN processing predictions THEN the system SHALL use the same error handling patterns as other working AI features
3. WHEN caching results THEN the system SHALL implement similar caching strategies to other AI features
4. WHEN displaying confidence scores THEN they SHALL reflect actual AI confidence levels, not mock percentages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want yield predictions that consider my specific location and local conditions, so that the recommendations are relevant to my farming context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL include GPS location data in the Gemini prompt
2. WHEN analyzing weather data THEN the system SHALL use real weather API data instead of mock weather information
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider local agricultural conditions and practices
4. WHEN calculating economic impact THEN the system SHALL use location-appropriate market prices and costs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the yield predictor to integrate with my existing field data, so that predictions are based on comprehensive information about my farm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has existing field data THEN the system SHALL retrieve and include relevant field information in predictions
2. WHEN historical yield data exists THEN the system SHALL incorporate it into the AI analysis
3. WHEN soil data is available THEN the system SHALL include soil health metrics in the prediction prompt
4. WHEN crop health scans exist THEN the system SHALL reference recent disease detection results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want yield predictions to provide actionable recommendations, so that I can take specific steps to improve my crop yields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations for yield improvement
2. WHEN risk factors are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest concrete mitigation strategies
3. WHEN optimization opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL present them with clear implementation steps and expected benefits
4. WHEN market timing is relevant THEN the system SHALL provide harvest timing recommendations based on price forecasts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the yield predictor to follow the same architectural patterns as other working AI features, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the fix THEN the code SHALL follow the same patterns used in CropDiseaseOracle.ts
2. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL use similar parsing and validation logic
3. WHEN managing state THEN the component SHALL follow React best practices used in other AI components
4. WHEN implementing error boundaries THEN the system SHALL use the same error handling approach as CropScanner
