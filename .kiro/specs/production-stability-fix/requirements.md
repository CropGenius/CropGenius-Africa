# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius application is experiencing critical production errors that are preventing users from accessing core functionality. These errors include database schema inconsistencies, Mapbox integration failures, and API communication issues. This feature addresses the immediate stability concerns to restore full application functionality and prevent user experience degradation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer using CropGenius, I want the application to load without errors so that I can access my field management tools reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page in the application THEN the system SHALL load without throwing JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to all required services without 400/406 HTTP errors
3. WHEN error boundaries are triggered THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical stack traces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer managing my fields, I want the field mapping functionality to work correctly so that I can visualize and manage my agricultural areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the field mapping interface THEN the MapboxFieldMap component SHALL render without throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
2. WHEN the Mapbox map initializes THEN the system SHALL properly handle all map lifecycle events including creation and destruction
3. WHEN users interact with field boundaries THEN the system SHALL maintain stable map state throughout the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer viewing my dashboard, I want my field data to load correctly so that I can see my farm health metrics and field information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL successfully query the fields table without "column does not exist" errors
2. WHEN fetching farm health data THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses without 406 errors
3. WHEN accessing field creation dates THEN the system SHALL use the correct column name (created_at vs created_by)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error logging and monitoring so that I can quickly identify and resolve production issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and context
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want robust error boundaries and fallback mechanisms so that single component failures don't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component throws an error THEN the error boundary SHALL catch it and display a fallback UI
2. WHEN critical services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality while maintaining core features
3. WHEN the application recovers from errors THEN the system SHALL restore full functionality without requiring a page refresh
