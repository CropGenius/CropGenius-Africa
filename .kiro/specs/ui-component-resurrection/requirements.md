# UI Component Resurrection Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resurrection of CropGenius UI components from their current state of deceptive facades into production-ready, AI-integrated agricultural intelligence systems. The analysis reveals a pattern of "UI lies" - components that appear functional but are disconnected from real data sources, creating a betrayal of farmer trust.

## Requirements

4. WHEN conversations occur THEN the system SHALL save them to a real chat_conversations table
5. WHEN quick actions are triggered THEN the system SHALL perform specialized functions not hardcoded messages
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful recovery options to the user
7. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL provide cached responses and sync when reconnected

### Requirement 2: HealthOrb Real-Time Monitoring

2. WHEN data is loading THEN it SHALL display a skeleton loader
3. WHEN data fails to load THEN it SHALL display an error state with retry option
4. WHEN health data is available THEN it SHALL drive the orb's color and animation based on actual health scores
5. WHEN trust indicators exist THEN it SHALL render them dynamically from real data
6. WHEN health score changes THEN the orb SHALL update its visual state in real-time

### Requirement 3: GodModeLayout Network Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer using the mobile app, I want accurate network and device status information, so that I can understand my connectivity and device state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layout loads THEN it SHALL connect to real network monitoring services
2. WHEN device status changes THEN it SHALL update battery, signal strength, and other metrics
3. WHEN notifications exist THEN it SHALL connect to a real notification system
4. WHEN achievements occur THEN it SHALL trigger celebrations based on real user accomplishments
5. WHEN user context changes THEN it SHALL update based on real authentication and user data

### Requirement 4: OneFingerNavigation Dynamic Routes

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want navigation that adapts to my permissions and available features, so that I only see relevant options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation loads THEN it SHALL generate routes based on user permissions
2. WHEN navigation state changes THEN it SHALL persist between sessions
3. WHEN user permissions change THEN it SHALL show/hide features accordingly
4. WHEN deep linking occurs THEN it SHALL support complex navigation patterns
5. WHEN notifications exist THEN it SHALL display badge indicators for updates

### Requirement 5: MobileLayout Voice and Haptic Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want voice commands and haptic feedback to work seamlessly, so that I can interact with the app hands-free and receive tactile confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice commands are spoken THEN the system SHALL connect to real voice recognition services
2. WHEN haptic feedback is triggered THEN it SHALL use the Web Vibration API
3. WHEN achievements occur THEN it SHALL connect to a real gamification backend
4. WHEN device status changes THEN it SHALL display accurate battery and network information
5. WHEN offline mode is active THEN it SHALL provide appropriate fallback functionality

### Requirement 6: Dashboard Data Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want my dashboard to show real farm statistics and activity, so that I can monitor my operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL use React Query hooks for data management
2. WHEN data is loading THEN it SHALL show appropriate loading states for each section
3. WHEN farm health is calculated THEN it SHALL use real data from field-ai-insights Edge Function
4. WHEN data needs refreshing THEN it SHALL provide refresh mechanisms
5. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide useful recovery options
6. WHEN data updates THEN it SHALL reflect changes in real-time

### Requirement 7: SuperDashboard Feature Activation

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to activate backend features that actually connect to real services, so that the system provides genuine functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN features are activated THEN they SHALL connect to real backend services
2. WHEN activation occurs THEN it SHALL verify user permissions
3. WHEN features are enabled THEN it SHALL provide real-time feedback
4. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN they SHALL show actual backend performance data
5. WHEN dependencies exist THEN it SHALL handle feature interdependencies correctly

### Requirement 8: Authentication System Integrity

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want a robust authentication system that handles all scenarios properly, so that my account and data are secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh and expiration properly
2. WHEN profiles are created THEN it SHALL avoid race conditions and handle all error cases
3. WHEN offline mode is active THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive caching and synchronization
4. WHEN referral bonuses are processed THEN it SHALL prevent duplicates and handle errors
5. WHEN multi-factor authentication is required THEN it SHALL support MFA flows
6. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive recovery strategies

### Requirement 9: Supabase Client Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Supabase client to be secure and reliable, so that data access is protected and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment validation fails THEN it SHALL use proper fallback mechanisms not hardcoded credentials
2. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive diagnostics
3. WHEN operations execute THEN they SHALL use consistent retry logic
4. WHEN debugging occurs THEN it SHALL not expose sensitive information in production
5. WHEN singleton patterns are used THEN they SHALL avoid potential testing and runtime issues

### Requirement 10: AuthProvider Optimization

**User Story:** As a farmer using the app, I want authentication to be fast and reliable, so that I can access my farm data quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the provider loads THEN it SHALL reduce complexity by removing unused states
2. WHEN debugging occurs THEN it SHALL minimize logging and protect sensitive information
3. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive recovery strategies
4. WHEN multi-factor authentication is needed THEN it SHALL support MFA flows
5. WHEN performance is critical THEN it SHALL optimize operations on mount

### Requirement 11: Route Protection Enhancement

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want route protection that handles all authentication scenarios, so that my access is properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions expire THEN guards SHALL handle expiration and refresh
