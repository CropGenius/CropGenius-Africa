# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius authentication system is experiencing critical issues that prevent users from signing in successfully. The system shows multiple GoTrueClient instances and 401 Unauthorized errors during the OAuth flow, indicating fundamental problems with the Supabase client configuration and API key management. This spec addresses the complete resolution of these authentication failures to restore user access to the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with Google OAuth without encountering API key errors, so that I can access the CropGenius platform successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Google sign-in button THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow without 401 errors
2. WHEN the OAuth callback is processed THEN the system SHALL successfully exchange the authorization code for a session token
3. WHEN the token exchange completes THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the dashboard with authenticated status
4. IF the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and fallback handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single Supabase client instance throughout the application, so that authentication state is consistent and warnings are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL create exactly one Supabase client instance
2. WHEN multiple components access the Supabase client THEN they SHALL all use the same singleton instance
3. WHEN the browser console is checked THEN there SHALL be no "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL receive consistent updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment variable validation and fallback handling, so that configuration issues are detected early and handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages with remediation steps
3. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL detect this during initialization and provide guidance
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to handle network failures and edge cases gracefully, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from accessing the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN the OAuth callback contains errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN session restoration fails THEN the system SHALL clear corrupted state and allow fresh sign-in attempts
4. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive authentication debugging and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve authentication issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed debug information in development mode
2. WHEN errors happen during authentication THEN the system SHALL capture error context and stack traces
3. WHEN the system is in production THEN sensitive information SHALL be excluded from logs
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step flow visibility
