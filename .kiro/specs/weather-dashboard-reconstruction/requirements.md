# Weather Dashboard Reconstruction Requirements

## Introduction

Based on the forensic investigation documented in the "Weather Dashboard Book of Lies," the current weather dashboard system is a catastrophic failure that requires complete reconstruction. This specification defines the requirements for building a truthful, reliable, and properly integrated weather dashboard system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Weather Data Architecture

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want consistent weather data across all components, so that I can trust the information I'm seeing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches weather data THEN it SHALL use a single, unified weather service
2. WHEN weather data is cached THEN it SHALL use a single caching strategy with consistent expiry times
3. WHEN weather data is displayed THEN all components SHALL show the same data for the same location and time
4. IF weather API fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages, not fake data
5. WHEN weather data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL NOT generate mock data without user knowledge

### Requirement 2: Honest Component Naming and Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component names to accurately reflect their functionality, so that I can understand and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is named "LiveWeatherPanel" THEN it SHALL display live weather data
2. WHEN a component is named "WeatherIntelligenceWidget" THEN it SHALL provide actual intelligent insights
3. WHEN a component is named "FieldDecisionEngine" THEN it SHALL use real AI/ML algorithms, not hardcoded if-else statements
4. WHEN a component claims to be "Enhanced" THEN it SHALL provide enhanced functionality over basic alternatives
5. IF a component cannot fulfill its naming promise THEN it SHALL be renamed to reflect its actual functionality

### Requirement 3: Real Field-Weather Integration

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want weather data specific to my field location, so that I can make informed decisions about my crops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a field THEN the weather data SHALL be fetched for that field's exact coordinates
2. WHEN no field is selected THEN the system SHALL prompt me to select or add a field
3. WHEN field coordinates are unavailable THEN the system SHALL NOT fall back to hardcoded coordinates
4. WHEN weather data is field-specific THEN it SHALL be clearly labeled with the field name and coordinates
5. IF multiple fields are selected THEN the system SHALL show weather data for each field separately

### Requirement 4: Transparent Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to know when weather data is unavailable or unreliable, so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather API fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
2. WHEN using demo/mock data THEN the system SHALL clearly label it as "Demo Data" or "Sample Data"
3. WHEN weather data is stale THEN the system SHALL show the last update timestamp
4. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show offline status and cached data age
5. IF weather data cannot be fetched THEN the system SHALL provide retry options, not silent failures

### Requirement 5: Genuine AI-Powered Farming Intelligence

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want AI-powered recommendations based on real weather data and agricultural science, so that I can optimize my farming operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating farming recommendations THEN the system SHALL use machine learning algorithms or scientific models
2. WHEN providing irrigation advice THEN it SHALL consider soil type, crop type, weather forecast, and historical data
3. WHEN suggesting spray timing THEN it SHALL analyze wind patterns, humidity, temperature, and precipitation forecasts
4. WHEN recommending harvest timing THEN it SHALL consider crop maturity, weather risks, and market conditions
5. IF AI recommendations are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show basic weather data only, not fake intelligence

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the weather dashboard to load quickly and reliably, so that I can access critical information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display weather data within 3 seconds
2. WHEN weather data is cached THEN it SHALL be served immediately while background refresh occurs
3. WHEN multiple components need weather data THEN they SHALL share the same data source to avoid duplicate API calls
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain responsive performance
5. IF weather service is slow THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators with timeout handling

### Requirement 7: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a farmer in the field, I want to access weather information on my mobile device, so that I can make real-time decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile THEN the dashboard SHALL be fully functional and readable
2. WHEN rotating device THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN using touch interface THEN all controls SHALL be easily accessible
4. WHEN network is slow THEN the mobile interface SHALL prioritize critical weather information
5. IF offline THEN the mobile app SHALL show cached weather data with clear timestamps

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my location and farming data to be secure and private, so that I can trust the system with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing weather data THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit and at rest
2. WHEN accessing location data THEN it SHALL require explicit user permission
3. WHEN sharing weather data THEN it SHALL be anonymized and aggregated
4. WHEN user deletes account THEN all associated weather and location data SHALL be permanently removed
5. IF data breach occurs THEN users SHALL be notified within 24 hours

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and testing, so that I can ensure system reliability and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather API fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be sent to administrators
3. WHEN new weather components are deployed THEN they SHALL pass comprehensive integration tests
4. WHEN weather data accuracy is questionable THEN the system SHALL flag it for review
5. IF system components fail THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL maintain basic functionality

### Requirement 10: User Education and Transparency

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand how weather recommendations are generated, so that I can make informed decisions about following them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN showing weather recommendations THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind them
2. WHEN displaying weather data THEN it SHALL show data sources and update timestamps
3. WHEN providing farming advice THEN it SHALL include confidence levels and uncertainty ranges
4. WHEN weather conditions are unusual THEN the system SHALL provide educational context
5. IF recommendations conflict with user experience THEN the system SHALL allow feedback and learning
