# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CropGenius database performance optimization addresses critical performance issues identified by Supabase's database linter. The system currently has 8 unindexed foreign keys causing suboptimal query performance, 22 unused indexes consuming storage and maintenance overhead, and 8 multiple permissive RLS policies creating performance bottlenecks. This optimization will improve query response times, reduce database maintenance overhead, and enhance overall application performance for our 100M+ target African farmers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CropGenius platform user, I want database queries to execute efficiently, so that I can access agricultural intelligence without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries data with foreign key relationships THEN the system SHALL execute queries with proper index coverage
2. WHEN the system performs JOIN operations on related tables THEN response times SHALL be optimized through appropriate indexing
3. WHEN users access field, farm, or task data THEN queries SHALL complete within acceptable performance thresholds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to eliminate unused indexes, so that database maintenance overhead is minimized and storage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs database maintenance operations THEN unused indexes SHALL NOT consume unnecessary resources
2. WHEN database storage is analyzed THEN only actively used indexes SHALL be present
3. WHEN index maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL only maintain indexes that improve query performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to consolidate multiple permissive RLS policies, so that database query performance is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are evaluated for data access THEN only one permissive policy per role/action combination SHALL be executed
2. WHEN users access fields or tasks data THEN RLS policy evaluation SHALL be streamlined for optimal performance
3. WHEN database security is maintained THEN consolidated policies SHALL preserve all existing access controls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to monitor database optimization results, so that I can verify improvements and track performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database optimizations are applied THEN performance metrics SHALL be measurable and documented
2. WHEN query performance is analyzed THEN improvements SHALL be quantifiable through before/after comparisons
3. WHEN the optimization is complete THEN the database linter SHALL report zero performance warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database schema changes to be applied safely, so that existing functionality is preserved during optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migrations are executed THEN all existing data SHALL remain intact and accessible
2. WHEN indexes are modified THEN application functionality SHALL continue to work without interruption
3. WHEN RLS policies are consolidated THEN user access permissions SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available if needed
