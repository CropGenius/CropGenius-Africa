# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MapboxFieldMap component is experiencing critical runtime errors that prevent users from accessing field mapping functionality. The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'indoor')" occurs during map cleanup and component unmounting, causing the entire application to crash. This issue needs immediate resolution to restore core field mapping capabilities for farmers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to access the field mapping functionality without encountering application crashes, so that I can define my field boundaries and manage my farm effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MapboxFieldMap component loads THEN the system SHALL initialize without throwing JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the component unmounts or is destroyed THEN the system SHALL clean up resources safely without accessing undefined properties
3. WHEN the map is being destroyed THEN the system SHALL check for property existence before accessing nested objects
4. IF the Mapbox GL instance is corrupted or partially destroyed THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the map component to handle network connectivity issues gracefully, so that I can continue using cached map data when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline AND cached map data exists THEN the system SHALL display the cached snapshot without attempting to initialize Mapbox GL
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL reinitialize the map component safely
3. WHEN switching between online and offline modes THEN the system SHALL not trigger cleanup errors
4. IF the map fails to initialize due to token issues THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and cleanup procedures in the map component, so that the application remains stable under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any map operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue functioning
2. WHEN cleaning up map resources THEN the system SHALL use defensive programming to check object existence
3. WHEN the component re-renders multiple times THEN the system SHALL prevent memory leaks and duplicate event listeners
4. IF the Mapbox access token is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with user-friendly messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the field drawing functionality to work reliably, so that I can accurately map my field boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start drawing a field boundary THEN the system SHALL allow me to place markers without errors
2. WHEN I complete a field boundary THEN the system SHALL save the coordinates and display the polygon correctly
3. WHEN I undo drawing actions THEN the system SHALL remove markers and update the display without errors
4. IF I have insufficient points for a polygon THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback without crashing
