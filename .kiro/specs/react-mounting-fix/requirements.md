# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CropGenius React application is currently failing to mount properly, displaying raw HTML instead of the rendered React components. This critical issue prevents users from accessing the application functionality. The root cause is a combination of React import errors, missing dependencies, and TypeScript configuration issues that cause JavaScript execution to fail, preventing React from initializing and mounting to the DOM.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React application to mount properly on localhost, so that users can access the CropGenius interface instead of seeing raw HTML.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is started with `npm run dev` THEN the React components SHALL render properly in the browser
2. WHEN visiting localhost THEN the user SHALL see the CropGenius React interface instead of raw HTML
3. WHEN React mounts THEN the root div SHALL be populated with the application components
4. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN there SHALL be no module resolution errors preventing React initialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React and dependency imports to resolve correctly, so that the JavaScript bundle can execute without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing React THEN the module SHALL resolve without "no default export" errors
2. WHEN importing @tanstack/react-query THEN the module SHALL be found and imported successfully
3. WHEN TypeScript compiles THEN there SHALL be no module resolution errors
4. WHEN the bundle loads THEN all dependencies SHALL be available for the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript configuration, so that module resolution works correctly for all imports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript processes imports THEN path resolution SHALL work correctly for all modules
2. WHEN using @ path aliases THEN they SHALL resolve to the correct src directory paths
3. WHEN importing node modules THEN TypeScript SHALL find the correct type declarations
4. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load completely, so that I can interact with all CropGenius features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN React SHALL mount and render the App component
2. WHEN React renders THEN the HashRouter SHALL initialize properly
3. WHEN routing initializes THEN the AuthProvider SHALL wrap the application
4. WHEN the app is ready THEN users SHALL be able to navigate and interact with features
