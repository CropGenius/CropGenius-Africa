# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the weather app's background image to use a specific high-quality agricultural/farming themed image from Unsplash. The current implementation uses a random placeholder image, but we need to replace it with a consistent, professional background that aligns with the agricultural theme of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the weather app, I want to see a consistent, high-quality agricultural background image, so that the visual experience is professional and thematically appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weather dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display the specific Unsplash image (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590867286251-8e26d9f255c0?q=80&w=687&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D) as the fullscreen background
2. WHEN the background image loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing gradient overlay for text readability
3. WHEN the background is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure the image covers the full viewport without distortion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the background image to load efficiently and gracefully handle loading states, so that the app performance remains optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the background image is loading THEN the system SHALL show the existing gradient as a fallback
2. IF the background image fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to the gradient background
3. WHEN the image loads THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth transition without layout shifts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the background implementation to be maintainable and follow best practices, so that future updates are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the background THEN the system SHALL use proper CSS background properties for optimal performance
2. WHEN the background is set THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility standards for text contrast
3. WHEN the code is updated THEN the system SHALL remove any unused variables or code related to the old background implementation
