# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Mapbox-based field mapping system has a critical usability issue: when users search for and select a location, the map remains static and doesn't navigate to the selected location. This creates a frustrating user experience where users can search for places but the map doesn't respond by showing the searched location. The system needs to implement dynamic map navigation that automatically moves, rotates, and zooms to any location the user searches for and selects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer using the field mapping tool, I want the map to automatically navigate to any location I search for and select, so that I can immediately see the area I'm interested in without manually panning and zooming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search input THEN the system SHALL provide real-time location suggestions using Mapbox Geocoding API
2. WHEN a user selects a location from search results THEN the map SHALL automatically fly to that location using smooth animation
3. WHEN the map navigates to a searched location THEN it SHALL center precisely on the selected coordinates with appropriate zoom level (15-16)
4. WHEN the map navigation occurs THEN it SHALL use flyTo animation with duration of 1-2 seconds for smooth user experience
5. IF the searched location requires rotation for better orientation THEN the map SHALL automatically adjust bearing for optimal viewing angle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user searching for locations, I want to see visual feedback during the search and navigation process, so that I understand the system is responding to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is typing in the search input THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during API calls
2. WHEN search results are available THEN the system SHALL display them in a dropdown with location names and details
3. WHEN a location is selected THEN the system SHALL show a temporary marker at the destination before navigation begins
4. WHEN map navigation is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that movement is occurring
5. WHEN navigation completes THEN the system SHALL place a persistent marker at the selected location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working in areas with poor connectivity, I want the search functionality to work offline using cached data and recent searches, so that I can still navigate to previously searched locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL display recent searches from local storage
2. WHEN a user selects a recent search while offline THEN the map SHALL navigate to the cached coordinates
3. WHEN the system is online THEN it SHALL cache successful search results for offline use
4. WHEN search fails due to connectivity THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. IF no cached data is available offline THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable search with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the map system, I want the navigation functionality to be robust and handle edge cases, so that users have a reliable experience across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid coordinates are provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and show appropriate error messages
2. WHEN multiple rapid search selections occur THEN the system SHALL cancel previous animations and start new navigation
3. WHEN the map is in drawing mode THEN search navigation SHALL be temporarily disabled to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide user-friendly fallback behavior
5. WHEN the component unmounts during navigation THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup ongoing animations and API calls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the search and navigation to work smoothly with touch interactions, so that I can efficiently find and navigate to locations on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using touch devices THEN the search dropdown SHALL be appropriately sized and touch-friendly
2. WHEN navigation occurs on mobile THEN the flyTo animation SHALL account for smaller screen real estate
3. WHEN the keyboard is open on mobile THEN the search interface SHALL remain accessible and functional
4. WHEN touch gestures conflict with navigation THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-initiated gestures over automatic navigation
5. WHEN the device orientation changes during navigation THEN the system SHALL maintain proper map positioning and zoom levels
