# Authentication Provider Architecture Fix

## Introduction
The CropGenius application is experiencing a critical authentication architecture issue where components are trying to access the AuthContext outside of the AuthProvider wrapper, resulting in a white screen and the error "useAuthContext must be used within an AuthProvider". This issue is preventing the application from loading properly in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix AuthProvider Context Scope

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load properly without authentication context errors, so that I can access CropGenius features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application loads THEN the AuthProvider SHALL properly wrap all components that need authentication context
2. WHEN components use useAuthContext THEN they SHALL have access to the authentication context without errors
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN there SHALL be no "useAuthContext must be used within an AuthProvider" errors
4. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL receive the updated context properly

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Multiple GoTrueClient Instances

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure there's only one Supabase auth client instance, so that authentication state is consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application initializes THEN there SHALL be only one GoTrueClient instance
2. WHEN authentication events occur THEN they SHALL be handled by a single auth client
3. WHEN the application runs THEN there SHALL be no "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected" warnings
4. WHEN users authenticate THEN the auth state SHALL be consistent across all components

### Requirement 3: Proper Provider Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React context providers to be properly ordered and scoped, so that all components have access to the contexts they need.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application renders THEN the AuthProvider SHALL be positioned correctly in the component tree
2. WHEN components need authentication context THEN they SHALL be wrapped by the AuthProvider
3. WHEN the ProtectedRoute component renders THEN it SHALL have access to the authentication context
4. WHEN the application structure is analyzed THEN there SHALL be no context provider ordering issues

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I get meaningful feedback instead of a blank screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN authentication initialization fails THEN the application SHALL show a proper error message
2. WHEN authentication context is missing THEN the application SHALL provide a fallback mechanism
3. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and reported appropriately
4. WHEN the application encounters auth issues THEN users SHALL be guided to resolve them

### Requirement 5: Development vs Production Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication behavior to be consistent between development and production environments, so that issues are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application runs in development THEN it SHALL use the same auth provider structure as production
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the behavior SHALL be identical in both environments
3. WHEN debugging authentication THEN the same context structure SHALL be available in both environments
4. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN they SHALL work consistently across environments

### Requirement 6: Loading State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see appropriate loading indicators during authentication initialization, so that I know the application is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN authentication is initializing THEN the application SHALL show a loading spinner
2. WHEN authentication initialization takes too long THEN the application SHALL provide a timeout mechanism
3. WHEN authentication fails to initialize THEN the application SHALL show an error state with retry options
4. WHEN authentication completes THEN the loading state SHALL be cleared and the app SHALL render

### Requirement 7: Context Provider Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper cleanup of authentication listeners and subscriptions, so that there are no memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the AuthProvider unmounts THEN all auth listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN authentication subscriptions are created THEN they SHALL be properly disposed of
3. WHEN the application closes THEN there SHALL be no lingering auth connections
4. WHEN components using auth context unmount THEN they SHALL not cause memory leaks
