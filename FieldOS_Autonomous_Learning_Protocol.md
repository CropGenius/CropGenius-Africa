**FieldOS: Autonomous Learning Protocol**

---

**Core Principle:** FieldOS is designed as a self-evolving system. Learning is continuous, triggered by new data, user feedback, and system performance monitoring, aligning with Prime Directive 5 (Replace Dev Ops with Autonomous Loops) and Prime Directive 3 (Engineer Memory + Learning Systems).

---

**1. Event-Triggered Insight Generation & Model Re-evaluation**

*   **Triggers:** The `FieldBrainRuntime` is not just invoked on demand by users but also proactively by system events.
    *   **Significant Weather Events:** Incoming alerts for frost, storms, heatwaves, etc., trigger `runFieldBrain` for affected fields to provide timely warnings and adaptive advice.
        *   *Source:* Data Ingestion Layer (Weather APIs).
    *   **Crop Growth Stage Transitions:** As crops reach key phenological stages (e.g., germination, flowering, fruiting), `runFieldBrain` can be triggered to reassess nutrient needs, pest vulnerability, and harvest timing.
        *   *Source:* Calculated from planting dates (FieldMemoryLayer) and degree-day models (Local AI Modules).
    *   **New Farmer Observations:** When a farmer logs a significant observation (e.g., "first sighting of X pest," "unexpected wilting"), this can trigger `runFieldBrain` to incorporate this new local data.
        *   *Source:* Farmer Interface Layer -> FieldMemoryLayer.
    *   **Cluster-Level Anomalies:** If `LearningKernel` detects a high incidence of a particular issue (e.g., disease outbreak) in a farmer cluster, it can trigger `runFieldBrain` for potentially affected fields within that cluster, even if they haven't reported it yet.
        *   *Source:* LearningKernel.
    *   **Scheduled Reviews:** Regular, periodic invocations of `runFieldBrain` (e.g., weekly) to provide routine updates and check for deviations from expected progress.
        *   *Source:* System Cron/Scheduler.

**2. The `feedback() -> retrain()` Loop (Prime Directive 5)**

*   **Capturing Feedback:**
    *   The `FieldIntelligenceReport` (see `FieldOS_Simulated_Field_Report.json`) explicitly requests feedback on the relevance and success of recommendations.
    *   Farmers use the Interface Layer to submit feedback:
        *   Overall report utility.
        *   Whether they implemented a specific recommended action.
        *   Observed outcome of implemented actions (e.g., "Pest X eradicated," "Yield increased as expected," "No noticeable effect," "Negative impact observed").
    *   This feedback is stored in `FieldMemoryLayer`, linked to the specific `reportId` and `actionId`.
*   **Processing Feedback (LearningKernel):**
    1.  `LearningKernel.processNewEvent()` is triggered when feedback is stored.
    2.  The feedback is associated with the context, historical data, and models used to generate the original recommendation.
    3.  **Positive Feedback:** Reinforces the weights/confidence of the rules, model parameters, or data patterns that led to successful advice.
    4.  **Negative Feedback/Ineffective Actions:**
        *   Flags the specific recommendation and its underlying logic for review.
        *   Decreases confidence scores for similar future recommendations under similar conditions.
        *   Triggers `LearningKernel.detectPatternDrift()`: If multiple negative feedbacks occur for a specific type of recommendation or model, it signals a potential pattern drift.
*   **Retraining/Adaptation (LearningKernel.adaptAdvice()):**
    *   **Trigger:** Detection of significant pattern drift, accumulation of sufficient negative feedback, or scheduled retraining cycles.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Relevant data (including historical performance, recent feedback, contextual data) is pulled from `FieldMemoryLayer`.
        2.  The specific Local AI Module or global model component responsible for the underperforming advice is identified.
        3.  Retraining occurs using the updated dataset. This might involve:
            *   Adjusting model weights.
            *   Modifying rules in a rule-based system.
            *   Exploring new features or data combinations.
        4.  The updated model is deployed (potentially after A/B testing).
    *   **Goal:** Continuously refine the accuracy and relevance of FieldOS advice based on real-world outcomes.

**3. Regional and Global Learning Synchronization (LearningKernel)**

*   **Local First, Global Second:** While Local AI Modules adapt to individual field conditions, `LearningKernel` facilitates broader learning.
*   **Anonymized Insight Aggregation:**
    *   `LearningKernel` periodically scans `FieldMemoryLayer` across multiple (consenting) farmer nodes.
    *   It aggregates anonymized data on successful strategies, emerging pests/diseases, crop performance variations, and environmental responses.
    *   This forms a regional or global dataset of agricultural patterns.
*   **Disseminating Knowledge:**
    *   **Updating Local AI Baselines:** Insights from aggregated data (e.g., a new resilient crop variety performing well in a region) can be used to update the baseline models or available options for Local AI Modules. This doesn't override local tuning but enriches it.
    *   **Informing `scanFarmerClusterInsights()`:** The aggregated data directly feeds the `scanFarmerClusterInsights` function, providing relevant, timely information to farmers about what's happening around them.
    *   **Identifying Large-Scale Drifts:** LearningKernel monitors global trends (e.g., climate change impacts on specific crops across regions) that might necessitate broader updates to simulation models or risk assessments.
*   **Security & Privacy:** All cross-node learning strictly adheres to anonymity and data sovereignty principles outlined in Secure Flow Contracts.

**4. Autonomous A/B Testing & Strategy Exploration (Pro User Feature)**

*   **Concept:** Allow the system to proactively (and safely) test variations of advice to discover better strategies.
*   **Mechanism (Pro Users Opt-In):**
    1.  For Pro users, `LearningKernel` can identify situations where multiple promising actions exist with similar confidence scores.
    2.  Instead of defaulting to one, it can offer (or with consent, automatically apply to a portion of the field/operations) slight variations (Strategy A vs. Strategy B).
        *   Example: Testing two different organic fertilizer application rates.
    3.  The outcomes are meticulously tracked in `FieldMemoryLayer`.
    4.  Successful variations are then incorporated into the general recommendation engine with higher confidence.
*   **Farmer-Initiated Forks (Pro User Feature):**
    *   As defined in `FieldOS_Core_Functions_Pseudocode.md` (`LearningKernel.manageSimulationFork`), Pro users can fork simulations, test their own strategies, and optionally share results back.
    *   If shared, these results become part of the `feedback() -> retrain()` loop, effectively allowing expert users to "teach" FieldOS.

---

**5. Monitoring and Alerting for Learning System Health**

*   **Meta-Learning:** The performance of `LearningKernel` itself is monitored.
    *   Are models consistently improving?
    *   Is feedback being incorporated effectively?
    *   Are there biases emerging in the learning process?
*   **Alerts:** Automated alerts are generated if:
    *   Key performance indicators (KPIs) for model accuracy drop significantly.
    *   Feedback volume decreases unexpectedly (suggesting UI/UX issues or disengagement).
    *   Significant pattern drifts are detected but models fail to adapt successfully.
*   **Human Oversight (Minimal):** While aiming for full autonomy, critical alerts related to learning system failure or unexpected negative outcomes may require human expert review as a final safeguard.

This Autonomous Learning Protocol ensures FieldOS is not static but a dynamic, improving intelligence, fulfilling the vision of a self-evolving agricultural operating system.
