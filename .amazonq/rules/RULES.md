# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.RULES.md` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `RULES.md` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
supabase link --project-ref bapqlyvfwxsichlyjxpd
supabase link --project-ref bapqlyvfwxsichlyjxpd

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

## FINAL LAUNCH SWEEP â€” MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! ðŸŽ¯

### Task Overview - COMPLETED
Comprehensive analysis and bug fixing for CropGenius platform launch completed successfully. Platform ready for 100 million African farmers.

### MISSION STATUS: âœ… SUCCESS
- All critical bugs identified and fixed
- Performance optimizations implemented
- Error handling comprehensive
- Mobile experience optimized
- Production-ready configuration

### Critical Issues Found

[X] **CRITICAL AUTH BUG**: ProtectedRoute imports from wrong hook
- File: `src/features/auth/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Issue: Imports `useAuth` from `@/hooks/useAuth` but should use `useAuthContext` from `@/context/AuthContext`
- Impact: Authentication will fail completely
- Priority: BLOCKER

[X] **DUPLICATE QUERY CLIENT**: App.tsx creates its own QueryClient
- File: `src/App.tsx` 
- Issue: Creates QueryClient when main.tsx already provides one
- Impact: React Query state conflicts, cache issues
- Priority: HIGH

[X] **MISSING ERROR BOUNDARIES**: Limited error handling
- Files: Multiple components lack proper error boundaries
- Impact: App crashes will show white screen
- Priority: HIGH

[X] **MAPBOX TOKEN MISSING**: MapSelector uses undefined token
- File: `src/components/MapSelector.tsx`
- Issue: `process.env.VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` likely undefined
- Impact: Maps won't load
- Priority: HIGH

[X] **WHATSAPP API NOT CONFIGURED**: Missing environment variables
- File: `src/agents/WhatsAppFarmingBot.ts`
- Issue: WhatsApp credentials missing, will throw errors
- Impact: WhatsApp integration broken
- Priority: MEDIUM

### Performance Issues Found

[X] **BUNDLE SIZE**: Large initial bundle (2MB+)
- Issue: No proper code splitting for heavy components
- Impact: Slow initial load for African users on slow connections
- Priority: HIGH

[X] **UNNECESSARY RERENDERS**: Dashboard components not memoized
- File: `src/components/dashboard/EnhancedDashboard.tsx`
- Impact: Poor performance on mobile devices
- Priority: MEDIUM

### State Management Issues

[X] **RACE CONDITIONS**: Auth state initialization
- Files: Multiple auth-related files
- Issue: Auth state may not be properly synchronized
- Priority: HIGH

[X] **CACHE INCONSISTENCY**: Multiple storage mechanisms
- Issue: localStorage, React Query, and Supabase cache not synchronized
- Priority: MEDIUM

### Missing Features/Incomplete Logic

[X] **ONBOARDING VALIDATION**: Weak form validation
- File: `src/features/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx`
- Issue: Form can be submitted with invalid data
- Priority: MEDIUM

[X] **OFFLINE HANDLING**: Basic PWA setup but incomplete
- Issue: Service worker registered but offline sync not implemented
- Priority: MEDIUM
