**FieldOS: High-Level System Blueprint**

**1. Core Components:**
    *   **Farmer Interface Layer:** (e.g., Mobile App, USSD, Web Portal) - How farmers interact, receive insights, and provide feedback.
    *   **Edge Functions Layer:** Secure, serverless functions acting as the primary API gateway.
        *   *Responsibility:* JWT authentication, RBAC, initial data validation, routing to FieldBrainRuntime.
    *   **Data Ingestion Layer:** Handles data from various sources (IoT sensors, weather APIs, farmer input, satellite imagery).
        *   *Responsibility:* Normalization, validation, and initial processing before feeding into FieldMemoryLayer and FieldBrainRuntime.
    *   **FieldBrainRuntime (Field Intelligence Engine):** The core decision-making engine.
        *   *Components:* Orchestrator, Context Fetcher, Historical Analyzer, Scenario Simulator, Cluster Insight Scanner, Action Planner.
        *   *Functionality:* Processes data to generate FieldIntelligenceReports.
    *   **FieldMemoryLayer:** Distributed, append-only storage for all field-related data.
        *   *Stores:* Sensor readings, events, farmer observations, actions taken, outcomes, feedback. Data is per-farmer, per-field.
        *   *Technology Hint:* Consider distributed ledger or immutable database concepts for data integrity and farmer ownership.
    *   **LearningKernel:** The adaptive intelligence layer.
        *   *Functionality:* Detects pattern drifts, runs A/B tests (for Pro users), updates models, syncs anonymized insights across regions. Operates on data from FieldMemoryLayer.
    *   **Local AI Modules:** AI models specific to a farmer's microclimate, soil, and crop history. Reside conceptually "at the edge" or are dynamically loaded by FieldBrainRuntime for a specific user context.

**2. Data and Control Flow:**
    *   **User Interaction:** Farmer inputs data/query via Interface Layer -> Edge Function.
    *   **Authentication & Routing:** Edge Function verifies JWT, checks RBAC -> Routes valid `field-ai-*` requests to FieldBrainRuntime broker. Other requests (e.g., profile update) handled by dedicated Edge Functions.
    *   **Data Ingestion:** External data (sensors, weather) -> Data Ingestion Layer -> FieldMemoryLayer & triggers FieldBrainRuntime if necessary (e.g., critical weather alert).
    *   **Intelligence Processing:** FieldBrainRuntime orchestrates its internal components, pulling data from FieldMemoryLayer (historical) and Data Ingestion Layer (real-time context).
    *   **Output & Feedback:** FieldIntelligenceReport -> Farmer Interface Layer. Farmer feedback -> Edge Function -> FieldMemoryLayer & LearningKernel.
    *   **Learning Loop:** LearningKernel analyzes FieldMemoryLayer (feedback, outcomes) -> Adapts Local AI Modules & global models -> Improved future FieldIntelligenceReports.

**3. Decentralization and Sovereignty (Prime Directive 6):**
    *   **Data Ownership:** FieldMemoryLayer is structured to ensure farmer data is segregated and owned by the farmer. Access is strictly controlled via RBAC.
    *   **Local AI:** FieldBrainRuntime utilizes Local AI Modules tuned to the specific farmer's conditions, ensuring advice is hyper-personalized.
    *   **Farmer as a Node:** Each farmer's data and local AI form a sovereign "node." Aggregated insights are anonymized and require consent if identifiable.

**4. Scalability:**
    *   **Serverless Edge:** Edge Functions scale automatically.
    *   **Distributed Storage:** FieldMemoryLayer designed for horizontal scaling.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** FieldBrainRuntime tasks can be queued and processed asynchronously.
    *   **Modular Design:** Components can be scaled independently.

**5. Security (Prime Directive 1 & 4):**
    *   **No Hard-Coding:** All user/system identifiers are dynamic. User context is established via verified JWTs.
    *   **RBAC Everywhere:** Edge Functions and FieldBrainRuntime enforce Role-Based Access Control at every interaction point.
    *   **Secure Broker:** All AI calls are funneled through a secure broker to FieldBrainRuntime.

**6. Autonomous Operation (Prime Directive 5):**
    *   **Event-Driven:** System reacts to new data, farmer feedback, or scheduled triggers (e.g., cron for regional model updates).
    *   **Continuous Learning:** LearningKernel constantly refines models based on new data and feedback loops.
    *   **Automated Deployment/Updates:** (Implied) Infrastructure for updating Edge Functions, FieldBrainRuntime, and LearningKernel models without manual intervention.

This blueprint provides the foundational structure for FieldOS.
