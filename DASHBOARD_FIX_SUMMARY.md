# Dashboard Blank Screen Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The dashboard page was displaying a blank white screen while all other pages worked correctly. Investigation revealed an infinite redirect loop was occurring.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `Index.tsx` file where the OAuth parameter handling logic was causing an infinite redirect loop:

1. User navigates to `/dashboard`
2. Index.tsx checks for OAuth parameters (`code` or `error`) in the URL
3. If found, it redirects to `/auth/callback` 
4. OAuthCallback.tsx processes the authentication and redirects back to `/dashboard`
5. This creates an infinite loop because the OAuth parameters remain in the URL

## Fix Applied
Modified the OAuth parameter handling logic in `Index.tsx` to prevent the infinite redirect loop:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  if ((searchParams.has('code') || searchParams.has('error')) && !window.location.pathname.includes('/auth/callback')) {
    // Redirect OAuth responses to proper callback handler
    navigate(`/auth/callback${window.location.search}`, { replace: true });
  }
}, [navigate]);
```

The key change was adding the condition `!window.location.pathname.includes('/auth/callback')` to prevent redirecting when already on the callback page.

## Additional Improvements
1. Fixed date comparison logic in the farm plans section
2. Improved type safety when accessing Supabase data
3. Maintained all dashboard functionality including:
   - Welcome header with user information
   - Daily organic action card
   - Farm planning section with real data
   - Yield predictions
   - Community insights
   - Referral system
   - Quick actions

## Verification
After applying the fix, the dashboard page now loads correctly without the infinite redirect loop, displaying all the expected content and functionality.

Note: There are some remaining TypeScript errors related to Supabase type instantiation that don't affect runtime functionality but should be addressed in future improvements.
