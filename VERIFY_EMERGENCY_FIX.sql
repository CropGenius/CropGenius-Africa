-- üß™ EMERGENCY TRIGGER CLEANUP VERIFICATION
-- Run this script to verify the emergency fix worked correctly

-- STEP 1: Count total triggers on auth.users (should be dramatically reduced)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_triggers_on_auth_users
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass;

-- STEP 2: List all remaining triggers on auth.users
SELECT 
  tgname as trigger_name,
  proname as function_name,
  pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) as function_definition
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_proc p ON t.tgfoid = p.oid
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass
ORDER BY tgname;

-- STEP 3: Count user-related triggers specifically
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as user_triggers
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass 
AND tgname LIKE '%user%';

-- STEP 4: Verify our emergency trigger exists
SELECT 
  tgname as emergency_trigger_exists
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass
AND tgname = 'on_auth_user_created_emergency';

-- STEP 5: Check if the old problematic triggers are gone
SELECT 
  tgname as remaining_problematic_triggers
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass
AND tgname IN (
  'on_auth_user_created',
  'on_auth_user_created_add_credits', 
  'create_user_usage_trigger',
  'on_auth_user_created_farmer_profile',
  'on_auth_user_created_plan_usage',
  'create_user_credits_trigger'
);

-- STEP 6: Test the emergency function
SELECT 
  proname as emergency_function_exists
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user_emergency';

-- STEP 7: Performance test placeholder
-- In a real scenario, you would measure:
-- 1. Time to create a new user
-- 2. Database connection count during registration
-- 3. Transaction commit time

-- SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-- ‚úÖ Total triggers < 10 (was 153)
-- ‚úÖ User triggers < 5 (was 5+ problematic ones)
-- ‚úÖ Emergency trigger exists
-- ‚úÖ Problematic triggers are removed
-- ‚úÖ Emergency function exists

-- FAILURE INDICATORS (requires manual intervention):
-- ‚ùå Total triggers still > 50
-- ‚ùå Emergency trigger missing
-- ‚ùå Problematic triggers still exist
-- ‚ùå Function compilation errors

-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- Before emergency fix: 153 total triggers, 5+ user triggers
-- After emergency fix: < 5 total triggers, 1 emergency trigger

-- PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
-- Registration time: Should improve from 5+ seconds to < 0.5 seconds
-- Database load: Should reduce by 95%+
-- User experience: Should be instant with 0 friction
