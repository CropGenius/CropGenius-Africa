   - Implemented use of cached data when offline
   - Added clear indicators of offline status
   - Implemented proper handling of offline-created fields

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added proper error handling for API failures
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages
   - Added fallbacks for map loading failures
   - Handled edge cases like missing tokens or network failures

4. **Enhanced UI/UX**
