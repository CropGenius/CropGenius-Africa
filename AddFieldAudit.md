# Add Field System Audit

## Core Issues Identified

1. **Session Persistence Issues**
   - The wizard has session storage code but doesn't properly restore all state on page reload
   - Missing proper cleanup of session storage after successful field creation

2. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Inconsistent validation across wizard steps
   - Some steps allow progression without required data
   - Missing error handling for API failures

3. **Map Integration Problems**
   - MapboxFieldMap component doesn't properly communicate boundary data back to wizard
   - Missing proper offline support for map functionality
   - No fallback for when map fails to load

4. **Data Flow Issues**
   - Inconsistent data flow between wizard steps
   - Field data not properly sanitized before submission
   - Missing proper type checking for field data

5. **Offline Support Gaps**
   - Incomplete offline support implementation
   - Missing proper sync mechanism for offline-created fields
   - Inconsistent offline status indicators
