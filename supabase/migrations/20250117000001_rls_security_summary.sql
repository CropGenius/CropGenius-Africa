-- RLS Security Issues Resolution Summary
-- Migration: Database Performance Optimization - RLS Security Fix

-- COMPLETED ACTIONS:
-- ✅ Created RLS policies for optimization_summary table (admin access only)
-- ✅ Created RLS policies for performance_baseline table (admin access only)  
-- ✅ Created RLS policies for removed_indexes_log table (admin access only)

-- SPATIAL_REF_SYS TABLE LIMITATION:
-- ❌ Cannot enable RLS on spatial_ref_sys table due to ownership restrictions
-- 
-- EXPLANATION:
-- The spatial_ref_sys table is a PostGIS system table owned by 'supabase_admin'
-- and cannot be modified by the postgres user. This table contains spatial 
-- reference system definitions and is typically read-only for application use.
--
-- RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:
-- 1. Configure PostgREST to exclude spatial_ref_sys from API exposure
-- 2. Move spatial_ref_sys to a non-public schema (requires supabase_admin privileges)
-- 3. Accept this as a known limitation since the table is read-only system data
--
-- SECURITY IMPACT:
-- Low - spatial_ref_sys contains public spatial reference system definitions
-- that are needed by PostGIS functions and don't contain sensitive user data.

-- Verify that our RLS policies are in place
