For your farm size, consider dividing fields into 3-4 sections and rotating cereals, legumes, and other crops annually. This naturally breaks pest cycles and improves soil fertility without heavy chemical inputs, potentially increasing yields by 15-20% within two seasons.",
        'crops': "For optimal maize cultivation in your region, plant at 75cm between rows and 25-30cm within rows. Apply nitrogen fertilizer as a top dressing when plants reach knee height (V6-V8 stage), approximately 30-35 days after emergence. Given current rainfall patterns, consider drought-tolerant varieties like Katumani or SAWA. Intercropping with beans or cowpeas can maximize land use and add nitrogen to soil.",
        'diseases': "Your description suggests Tomato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans). This fungal disease spreads rapidly in humid conditions above 90% and temperatures of 15-25Â°C. Immediately remove and destroy affected leaves, apply copper-based fungicide (Bordeaux mixture) every 7-10 days, and improve air circulation between plants. For prevention, use resistant varieties like 'Mountain Magic' and maintain proper plant spacing.",
        'machinery': "For a 2-5 hectare farm, a two-wheel tractor (12-15 HP) offers better cost-efficiency than a four-wheel tractor. The Kukje EF453T model (approximately 3,200 USD) provides excellent versatility with attachments for plowing, harrowing, and transportation. Maintenance costs average 200-250 USD annually with proper care. For smaller plots, consider the Amir walking tractor, which costs less but still handles multiple farm operations effectively.",
        'market': "Current maize prices are trending upward by 12-15% across East Africa markets due to lower regional production and increased demand. Based on five-year historical data, prices typically peak 3-4 months post-harvest. Consider storage if you have proper facilities, as projections indicate a potential 18-22% price increase within the next quarter. For immediate sales, target urban wholesale markets for 5-8% premium over local markets."
