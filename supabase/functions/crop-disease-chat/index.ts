  return `ðŸ©º **Crop Disease Analysis**

Based on your description and location in ${region}, here's what I can help you with:

**Common Issues in Your Area:**
${relevantDiseases.map(disease => `â€¢ ${disease}`).join('\n')}

**Immediate Assessment Steps:**
â€¢ Examine affected plants closely for specific symptoms
â€¢ Check if the problem is spreading to nearby plants
â€¢ Note environmental conditions (recent weather, irrigation changes)
â€¢ Take clear photos of affected areas if possible

**General Treatment Approach:**
â€¢ **Organic Solutions:** Neem oil spray, copper-based fungicides, beneficial bacteria
â€¢ **Cultural Practices:** Improve air circulation, adjust watering, remove affected plant parts
â€¢ **Preventive Measures:** Crop rotation, resistant varieties, proper spacing

**When to Seek Help:**
â€¢ If symptoms spread rapidly (within 24-48 hours)
â€¢ If more than 25% of plants are affected
â€¢ If you're unsure about the diagnosis

**Economic Considerations:**
â€¢ Early intervention typically costs 10-20% of potential crop loss
â€¢ Preventive treatments are usually 5x more cost-effective than curative ones

For a precise diagnosis, please upload a clear photo of the affected plants, or describe the specific symptoms you're seeing (leaf color, spots, wilting patterns, etc.).

Would you like me to help you identify specific symptoms or recommend treatments for a particular disease?`;

  return `ðŸŒ± **Crop Health Guidance**

I'm here to help you maintain healthy crops in ${region}. Here's some general guidance:

**Preventive Health Measures:**
â€¢ **Regular Monitoring:** Check plants weekly for early signs of problems
â€¢ **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil tests
â€¢ **Water Management:** Maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging
â€¢ **Air Circulation:** Proper plant spacing to prevent fungal issues

**Seasonal Considerations for ${season}:**
â€¢ Monitor for weather-related stress
â€¢ Adjust irrigation based on rainfall patterns
â€¢ Watch for seasonal pests and diseases
â€¢ Consider protective measures during extreme weather

**Early Warning Signs to Watch For:**
â€¢ Changes in leaf color or texture
â€¢ Unusual growth patterns
â€¢ Presence of insects or their damage
â€¢ Wilting despite adequate water

**Best Practices:**
â€¢ Keep detailed records of treatments and observations
â€¢ Use integrated pest management approaches
â€¢ Maintain soil health through organic matter
â€¢ Practice crop rotation when possible

**When to Take Action:**
â€¢ At first sign of unusual symptoms
â€¢ Before problems spread to multiple plants
â€¢ When environmental stress is high

Is there a specific aspect of crop health you'd like to discuss, or do you have particular symptoms you're concerned about?`;
