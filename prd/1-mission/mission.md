# PRD Section 1: Mission Definition

## 1.1 Objective

To design, build, and deploy the most visually advanced, psychologically intuitive, and backend-perfect agricultural intelligence platform, CropGenius. The system must be 100% production-ready, scalable to 100 million African farmers, and provide tangible value by solving their most pressing agricultural challenges.

## 1.2 Target Audience

Farmers across Africa, ranging from smallholders to large-scale agricultural enterprises. The UI and UX must be accessible, intuitive, and functional even in low-bandwidth environments.

## 1.3 Core Problem Solved

CropGenius addresses critical gaps in agricultural intelligence by providing farmers with actionable, data-driven insights. Key problems solved include:

- **Crop Disease:** Real-time identification and AI-powered treatment plans.
- **Market Access:** Access to fair, location-based market pricing and supplier information.
- **Farm Management:** AI-driven farm plans optimized for specific crops, locations, and conditions.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Actionable weather and satellite data to mitigate risks and optimize yields.

## 1.4 Definition of Done

The mission is complete only when the CropGenius application is:

- **Flawlessly Executed:** All 15 PRD sections are marked as "Executed Flawlessly."
- **Fully Validated:** The system passes all automated tests, manual QA, and self-validation checks across all features.
- **Secure & Scalable:** All Supabase RLS policies are enforced, secrets are secured in Edge Functions, and the infrastructure is confirmed to be ready for 100 million users.
- **User-Centric:** The UI/UX is intuitive, performant, and delivers a superior user experience, meeting the "Apple Envy Award" standard.
- **Production Ready:** A final, successful deployment is achieved, and the `FINAL_DEPLOYABLE_SUMMARY.md` is generated.
