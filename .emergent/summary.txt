npm@10.8.2 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm conflicts, and ensuring both frontend and backend (FastAPI and React/Vite) were operational. Key API keys (OpenWeatherMap, Sentinel Hub) were successfully acquired and configured. The engineer then conducted comprehensive backend testing, identifying critical issues: Sentinel Hub authentication failure, missing Crop Disease Edge Function, and non-existent  table. A crucial architectural correction was made, realizing the backend primarily uses Supabase Edge Functions, not FastAPI. The engineer systematically addressed Sentinel Hub OAuth2, updated relevant files, and attempted to create the  table. Despite significant backend progress, the user expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the UI, demanding a God-Mode redesign with highly detailed psychological and visual specifications. The AI engineer, acknowledging the UI's inadequacy, pivoted entirely to focus on this ambitious UI/UX transformation.

<product_requirements>
The CropGenius application aims to be a transformative agricultural intelligence platform for African farmers, emphasizing robustness, scalability, and intuitive design. Core features include a **Crop Disease Detection Oracle** (PlantNet integration), a **Weather Prophecy Engine** (OpenWeatherMap), a **Market Intelligence Oracle**, **Satellite Field Intelligence** (Sentinel Hub, NDVI analysis), and a **WhatsApp Farming Genius**. A critical recent shift prioritizes an unparalleled, God-Mode UI/UX. This involves: **Trust-first DNA** with clarity, momentum, emotion, simplicity, and respect for farmers; **Addiction Loops** (Field Map, Score, WhatsApp AI); a **Visually Stunning System** (specific fonts, colors, buttons, motion, grid layouts); **Mobile UX Secrets** (chunking, ghost mode, one-finger design, offline caching, smart defaults); **High-Conversion Tactics** (progress framing, social proof, urgency, gamification); **Dark UX for Good** (emotional snapshots, predictive personalization); and **Award-Winning Design Psychology** (Zeigarnik, Hick's Law, Peak-End Rule). The UI must be mobile-first, futuristic, highly interactive, and emotionally magnetic.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), Supabase (Backend, Database, Edge Functions).
-   **Authentication**: Supabase Auth, OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Flow for Sentinel Hub).
-   **External Integrations**: PlantNet API (Crop Disease), OpenWeatherMap API (Weather), Sentinel Hub API (Satellite Imagery), Gemini API (AI advice/chat), WhatsApp Business API (Messaging - planned).
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations).
-   **Build Tools**: Vite (Frontend).
-   **Deployment/Runtime**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process management.
-   **Data Handling**: Environment variables (), JSON, UUIDs, Supabase Row Level Security (RLS).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

The application primarily leverages **Supabase Edge Functions** for its backend logic, despite initially appearing to use FastAPI. This was a key clarification during the trajectory.

-   : Updated to include  and , , and  for backend API integrations.
-   : Similarly updated with , , , , and  for frontend access to these keys.
-    (New file): Created to centralize the OAuth2 client credentials flow for Sentinel Hub, handling token acquisition and refresh. This is crucial for fixing the 401 authentication error previously encountered.
-   : Modified to use the new  for authenticated Sentinel Hub API calls, replacing the previous simple API key usage.
-   : Modified to integrate the PlantNet API Key and prepare for Gemini AI integration for detailed disease advice.
-   : This Edge Function exists and is critical for the Crop Disease Detection feature. The analysis confirmed its presence and structure, but its deployment status remains an issue.
-    and : These Edge Functions for Weather Prophecy and Satellite Field Intelligence were confirmed to exist and are working post-fixes.
-    (New file): Created as a SQL script to define the  table schema, which was identified as missing. This is a critical database component for the Market Intelligence feature.
-    (New file): Created as a temporary script to populate sample market data, due to the inability to run SQL migrations directly.
-    (New file): Created to document how to deploy Supabase Edge Functions, as the Supabase CLI was not available for direct deployment.
-    (New file): Created to log implementation progress and status.
-   , ,  (New files): Created as initial attempts to rebuild the frontend UI, though the user deemed them insufficient, prompting a complete UI/UX overhaul.

The core of the backend functionality for weather and satellite intelligence now resides in Supabase Edge Functions, with the frontend interacting with these functions and other external APIs. Authentication for Sentinel Hub has been upgraded to a more robust OAuth2 flow.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Deploy Supabase Edge Functions (specifically ) to the production environment.
-   Create and deploy the  table in the Supabase database.
-   Thoroughly test the Crop Disease Detection feature end-to-end, including PlantNet API integration with better test images and Gemini AI advice generation.
-   Fully implement and test the Market Intelligence Oracle to display real market prices professionally.
-   Implement the WhatsApp Farming Genius integration.
-   Execute the comprehensive God-Mode UI/UX redesign across the entire frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed significant backend work, ensuring the **Weather Prophecy Engine** and **Satellite Field Intelligence** features were fully functional with real API integrations (OpenWeatherMap and Sentinel Hub, with its new OAuth2 authentication). **Supabase Authentication** also works correctly. The **Gemini AI Treatment Advice** component was integrated and confirmed working.

However, two critical issues remained: the **Crop Disease Detection** Supabase Edge Function () was still not deployed/accessible (resulting in 404 errors), and the  database table for **Market Intelligence** was missing. The AI engineer attempted to address these by creating a SQL migration script () and a data setup utility (), alongside a deployment guide for Edge Functions.

The most recent shift in focus, driven by explicit user feedback, concerns the frontend UI. Although the AI engineer made initial attempts to create new frontend components (, , ) to enhance the UI, the user vehemently criticized the existing UI as trash and inadequate, demanding an immediate and complete God-Mode UI/UX overhaul based on highly detailed psychological and visual specifications provided across multiple UX Layer documents. The application currently stands with a robust backend for key features, but the frontend requires a complete, visionary redesign to meet the user's ambitious aesthetic and psychological requirements.

<optional_next_step>
My next step is to analyze the current frontend routing structure to systematically rebuild the UI as per the user's detailed God-Mode design blueprint.
